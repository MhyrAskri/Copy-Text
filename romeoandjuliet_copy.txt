1- Two households, both alike in dignity,
2- In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
3- From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
4- Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
5- From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
6- A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;
7- Whose misadventured piteous overthrows
8- Do with their death bury their parents' strife.
9- The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,
10- And the continuance of their parents' rage,
11- Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,
12- Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;
13- The which if you with patient ears attend,
14- What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.
15- SCENE I. Verona. A public place.
16- 
17- Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords and bucklers
18- SAMPSON
19- Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.
20- GREGORY
21- No, for then we should be colliers.
22- SAMPSON
23- I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.
24- GREGORY
25- Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o' the collar.
26- SAMPSON
27- I strike quickly, being moved.
28- GREGORY
29- But thou art not quickly moved to strike.
30- SAMPSON
31- A dog of the house of Montague moves me.
32- GREGORY
33- To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand:
34- therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.
35- SAMPSON
36- A dog of that house shall move me to stand: I will
37- take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.
38- GREGORY
39- That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes
40- to the wall.
41- SAMPSON
42- True; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,
43- are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push
44- Montague's men from the wall, and thrust his maids
45- to the wall.
46- GREGORY
47- The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.
48- SAMPSON
49- 'Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I
50- have fought with the men, I will be cruel with the
51- maids, and cut off their heads.
52- GREGORY
53- The heads of the maids?
54- SAMPSON
55- Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads;
56- take it in what sense thou wilt.
57- GREGORY
58- They must take it in sense that feel it.
59- SAMPSON
60- Me they shall feel while I am able to stand: and
61- 'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.
62- GREGORY
63- 'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou
64- hadst been poor John. Draw thy tool! here comes
65- two of the house of the Montagues.
66- SAMPSON
67- My naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee.
68- GREGORY
69- How! turn thy back and run?
70- SAMPSON
71- Fear me not.
72- GREGORY
73- No, marry; I fear thee!
74- SAMPSON
75- Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.
76- GREGORY
77- I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as
78- they list.
79- SAMPSON
80- Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them;
81- which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.
82- Enter ABRAHAM and BALTHASAR
83- 
84- ABRAHAM
85- Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
86- SAMPSON
87- I do bite my thumb, sir.
88- ABRAHAM
89- Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
90- SAMPSON
91- [Aside to GREGORY] Is the law of our side, if I say
92- ay?
93- GREGORY
94- No.
95- SAMPSON
96- No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but I
97- bite my thumb, sir.
98- GREGORY
99- Do you quarrel, sir?
100- ABRAHAM
101- Quarrel sir! no, sir.
102- SAMPSON
103- If you do, sir, I am for you: I serve as good a man as you.
104- ABRAHAM
105- No better.
106- SAMPSON
107- Well, sir.
108- GREGORY
109- Say 'better:' here comes one of my master's kinsmen.
110- SAMPSON
111- Yes, better, sir.
112- ABRAHAM
113- You lie.
114- SAMPSON
115- Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.
116- They fight
117- 
118- Enter BENVOLIO
119- 
120- BENVOLIO
121- Part, fools!
122- Put up your swords; you know not what you do.
123- Beats down their swords
124- 
125- Enter TYBALT
126- 
127- TYBALT
128- What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?
129- Turn thee, Benvolio, look upon thy death.
130- BENVOLIO
131- I do but keep the peace: put up thy sword,
132- Or manage it to part these men with me.
133- TYBALT
134- What, drawn, and talk of peace! I hate the word,
135- As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee:
136- Have at thee, coward!
137- They fight
138- 
139- Enter, several of both houses, who join the fray; then enter Citizens, with clubs
140- 
141- First Citizen
142- Clubs, bills, and partisans! strike! beat them down!
143- Down with the Capulets! down with the Montagues!
144- Enter CAPULET in his gown, and LADY CAPULET
145- 
146- CAPULET
147- What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!
148- LADY CAPULET
149- A crutch, a crutch! why call you for a sword?
150- CAPULET
151- My sword, I say! Old Montague is come,
152- And flourishes his blade in spite of me.
153- Enter MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE
154- 
155- MONTAGUE
156- Thou villain Capulet,--Hold me not, let me go.
157- LADY MONTAGUE
158- Thou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe.
159- Enter PRINCE, with Attendants
160- 
161- PRINCE
162- Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
163- Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,--
164- Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,
165- That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
166- With purple fountains issuing from your veins,
167- On pain of torture, from those bloody hands
168- Throw your mistemper'd weapons to the ground,
169- And hear the sentence of your moved prince.
170- Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,
171- By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,
172- Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets,
173- And made Verona's ancient citizens
174- Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,
175- To wield old partisans, in hands as old,
176- Canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate:
177- If ever you disturb our streets again,
178- Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
179- For this time, all the rest depart away:
180- You Capulet; shall go along with me:
181- And, Montague, come you this afternoon,
182- To know our further pleasure in this case,
183- To old Free-town, our common judgment-place.
184- Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.
185- Exeunt all but MONTAGUE, LADY MONTAGUE, and BENVOLIO
186- 
187- MONTAGUE
188- Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?
189- Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?
190- BENVOLIO
191- Here were the servants of your adversary,
192- And yours, close fighting ere I did approach:
193- I drew to part them: in the instant came
194- The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared,
195- Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears,
196- He swung about his head and cut the winds,
197- Who nothing hurt withal hiss'd him in scorn:
198- While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,
199- Came more and more and fought on part and part,
200- Till the prince came, who parted either part.
201- LADY MONTAGUE
202- O, where is Romeo? saw you him to-day?
203- Right glad I am he was not at this fray.
204- BENVOLIO
205- Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun
206- Peer'd forth the golden window of the east,
207- A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;
208- Where, underneath the grove of sycamore
209- That westward rooteth from the city's side,
210- So early walking did I see your son:
211- Towards him I made, but he was ware of me
212- And stole into the covert of the wood:
213- I, measuring his affections by my own,
214- That most are busied when they're most alone,
215- Pursued my humour not pursuing his,
216- And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.
217- MONTAGUE
218- Many a morning hath he there been seen,
219- With tears augmenting the fresh morning dew.
220- Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;
221- But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
222- Should in the furthest east begin to draw
223- The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,
224- Away from the light steals home my heavy son,
225- And private in his chamber pens himself,
226- Shuts up his windows, locks far daylight out
227- And makes himself an artificial night:
228- Black and portentous must this humour prove,
229- Unless good counsel may the cause remove.
230- BENVOLIO
231- My noble uncle, do you know the cause?
232- MONTAGUE
233- I neither know it nor can learn of him.
234- BENVOLIO
235- Have you importuned him by any means?
236- MONTAGUE
237- Both by myself and many other friends:
238- But he, his own affections' counsellor,
239- Is to himself--I will not say how true--
240- But to himself so secret and so close,
241- So far from sounding and discovery,
242- As is the bud bit with an envious worm,
243- Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
244- Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
245- Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow.
246- We would as willingly give cure as know.
247- Enter ROMEO
248- 
249- BENVOLIO
250- See, where he comes: so please you, step aside;
251- I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.
252- MONTAGUE
253- I would thou wert so happy by thy stay,
254- To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away.
255- Exeunt MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE
256- 
257- BENVOLIO
258- Good-morrow, cousin.
259- ROMEO
260- Is the day so young?
261- BENVOLIO
262- But new struck nine.
263- ROMEO
264- Ay me! sad hours seem long.
265- Was that my father that went hence so fast?
266- BENVOLIO
267- It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
268- ROMEO
269- Not having that, which, having, makes them short.
270- BENVOLIO
271- In love?
272- ROMEO
273- Out--
274- BENVOLIO
275- Of love?
276- ROMEO
277- Out of her favour, where I am in love.
278- BENVOLIO
279- Alas, that love, so gentle in his view,
280- Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
281- ROMEO
282- Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still,
283- Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!
284- Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?
285- Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
286- Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.
287- Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!
288- O any thing, of nothing first create!
289- O heavy lightness! serious vanity!
290- Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
291- Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire,
292- sick health!
293- Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!
294- This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
295- Dost thou not laugh?
296- BENVOLIO
297- No, coz, I rather weep.
298- ROMEO
299- Good heart, at what?
300- BENVOLIO
301- At thy good heart's oppression.
302- ROMEO
303- Why, such is love's transgression.
304- Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
305- Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest
306- With more of thine: this love that thou hast shown
307- Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
308- Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs;
309- Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;
310- Being vex'd a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears:
311- What is it else? a madness most discreet,
312- A choking gall and a preserving sweet.
313- Farewell, my coz.
314- BENVOLIO
315- Soft! I will go along;
316- An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
317- ROMEO
318- Tut, I have lost myself; I am not here;
319- This is not Romeo , he's some other where.
320- BENVOLIO
321- Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.
322- ROMEO
323- What, shall I groan and tell thee?
324- BENVOLIO
325- Groan! why, no.
326- But sadly tell me who.
327- ROMEO
328- Bid a sick man in sadness make his will:
329- Ah, word ill urged to one that is so ill!
330- In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
331- BENVOLIO
332- I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.
333- ROMEO
334- A right good mark-man! And she's fair I love.
335- BENVOLIO
336- A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.
337- ROMEO
338- Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit
339- With Cupid's arrow; she hath Dian's wit;
340- And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,
341- From love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.
342- She will not stay the siege of loving terms,
343- Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes,
344- Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:
345- O, she is rich in beauty, only poor,
346- That when she dies with beauty dies her store.
347- BENVOLIO
348- Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
349- ROMEO
350- She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste,
351- For beauty starved with her severity
352- Cuts beauty off from all posterity.
353- She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,
354- To merit bliss by making me despair:
355- She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow
356- Do I live dead that live to tell it now.
357- BENVOLIO
358- Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.
359- ROMEO
360- O, teach me how I should forget to think.
361- BENVOLIO
362- By giving liberty unto thine eyes;
363- Examine other beauties.
364- ROMEO
365- 'Tis the way
366- To call hers exquisite, in question more:
367- These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows
368- Being black put us in mind they hide the fair;
369- He that is strucken blind cannot forget
370- The precious treasure of his eyesight lost:
371- Show me a mistress that is passing fair,
372- What doth her beauty serve, but as a note
373- Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?
374- Farewell: thou canst not teach me to forget.
375- BENVOLIO
376- I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.
377- Exeunt
378- 
379- SCENE II. A street.
380- 
381- Enter CAPULET, PARIS, and Servant
382- CAPULET
383- But Montague is bound as well as I,
384- In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think,
385- For men so old as we to keep the peace.
386- PARIS
387- Of honourable reckoning are you both;
388- And pity 'tis you lived at odds so long.
389- But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?
390- CAPULET
391- But saying o'er what I have said before:
392- My child is yet a stranger in the world;
393- She hath not seen the change of fourteen years,
394- Let two more summers wither in their pride,
395- Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
396- PARIS
397- Younger than she are happy mothers made.
398- CAPULET
399- And too soon marr'd are those so early made.
400- The earth hath swallow'd all my hopes but she,
401- She is the hopeful lady of my earth:
402- But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,
403- My will to her consent is but a part;
404- An she agree, within her scope of choice
405- Lies my consent and fair according voice.
406- This night I hold an old accustom'd feast,
407- Whereto I have invited many a guest,
408- Such as I love; and you, among the store,
409- One more, most welcome, makes my number more.
410- At my poor house look to behold this night
411- Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:
412- Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
413- When well-apparell'd April on the heel
414- Of limping winter treads, even such delight
415- Among fresh female buds shall you this night
416- Inherit at my house; hear all, all see,
417- And like her most whose merit most shall be:
418- Which on more view, of many mine being one
419- May stand in number, though in reckoning none,
420- Come, go with me.
421- To Servant, giving a paper
422- 
423- Go, sirrah, trudge about
424- Through fair Verona; find those persons out
425- Whose names are written there, and to them say,
426- My house and welcome on their pleasure stay.
427- Exeunt CAPULET and PARIS
428- 
429- Servant
430- Find them out whose names are written here! It is
431- written, that the shoemaker should meddle with his
432- yard, and the tailor with his last, the fisher with
433- his pencil, and the painter with his nets; but I am
434- sent to find those persons whose names are here
435- writ, and can never find what names the writing
436- person hath here writ. I must to the learned.--In good time.
437- Enter BENVOLIO and ROMEO
438- 
439- BENVOLIO
440- Tut, man, one fire burns out another's burning,
441- One pain is lessen'd by another's anguish;
442- Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;
443- One desperate grief cures with another's languish:
444- Take thou some new infection to thy eye,
445- And the rank poison of the old will die.
446- ROMEO
447- Your plaintain-leaf is excellent for that.
448- BENVOLIO
449- For what, I pray thee?
450- ROMEO
451- For your broken shin.
452- BENVOLIO
453- Why, Romeo, art thou mad?
454- ROMEO
455- Not mad, but bound more than a mad-man is;
456- Shut up in prison, kept without my food,
457- Whipp'd and tormented and--God-den, good fellow.
458- Servant
459- God gi' god-den. I pray, sir, can you read?
460- ROMEO
461- Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.
462- Servant
463- Perhaps you have learned it without book: but, I
464- pray, can you read any thing you see?
465- ROMEO
466- Ay, if I know the letters and the language.
467- Servant
468- Ye say honestly: rest you merry!
469- ROMEO
470- Stay, fellow; I can read.
471- Reads
472- 
473- 'Signior Martino and his wife and daughters;
474- County Anselme and his beauteous sisters; the lady
475- widow of Vitravio; Signior Placentio and his lovely
476- nieces; Mercutio and his brother Valentine; mine
477- uncle Capulet, his wife and daughters; my fair niece
478- Rosaline; Livia; Signior Valentio and his cousin
479- Tybalt, Lucio and the lively Helena.' A fair
480- assembly: whither should they come?
481- Servant
482- Up.
483- ROMEO
484- Whither?
485- Servant
486- To supper; to our house.
487- ROMEO
488- Whose house?
489- Servant
490- My master's.
491- ROMEO
492- Indeed, I should have ask'd you that before.
493- Servant
494- Now I'll tell you without asking: my master is the
495- great rich Capulet; and if you be not of the house
496- of Montagues, I pray, come and crush a cup of wine.
497- Rest you merry!
498- Exit
499- 
500- BENVOLIO
501- At this same ancient feast of Capulet's
502- Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lovest,
503- With all the admired beauties of Verona:
504- Go thither; and, with unattainted eye,
505- Compare her face with some that I shall show,
506- And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.
507- ROMEO
508- When the devout religion of mine eye
509- Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires;
510- And these, who often drown'd could never die,
511- Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars!
512- One fairer than my love! the all-seeing sun
513- Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun.
514- BENVOLIO
515- Tut, you saw her fair, none else being by,
516- Herself poised with herself in either eye:
517- But in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd
518- Your lady's love against some other maid
519- That I will show you shining at this feast,
520- And she shall scant show well that now shows best.
521- ROMEO
522- I'll go along, no such sight to be shown,
523- But to rejoice in splendor of mine own.
524- Exeunt
525- 
526- SCENE III. A room in Capulet's house.
527- 
528- Enter LADY CAPULET and Nurse
529- LADY CAPULET
530- Nurse, where's my daughter? call her forth to me.
531- Nurse
532- Now, by my maidenhead, at twelve year old,
533- I bade her come. What, lamb! what, ladybird!
534- God forbid! Where's this girl? What, Juliet!
535- Enter JULIET
536- 
537- JULIET
538- How now! who calls?
539- Nurse
540- Your mother.
541- JULIET
542- Madam, I am here.
543- What is your will?
544- LADY CAPULET
545- This is the matter:--Nurse, give leave awhile,
546- We must talk in secret:--nurse, come back again;
547- I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel.
548- Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age.
549- Nurse
550- Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.
551- LADY CAPULET
552- She's not fourteen.
553- Nurse
554- I'll lay fourteen of my teeth,--
555- And yet, to my teeth be it spoken, I have but four--
556- She is not fourteen. How long is it now
557- To Lammas-tide?
558- LADY CAPULET
559- A fortnight and odd days.
560- Nurse
561- Even or odd, of all days in the year,
562- Come Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen.
563- Susan and she--God rest all Christian souls!--
564- Were of an age: well, Susan is with God;
565- She was too good for me: but, as I said,
566- On Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen;
567- That shall she, marry; I remember it well.
568- 'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;
569- And she was wean'd,--I never shall forget it,--
570- Of all the days of the year, upon that day:
571- For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,
572- Sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall;
573- My lord and you were then at Mantua:--
574- Nay, I do bear a brain:--but, as I said,
575- When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple
576- Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,
577- To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!
578- Shake quoth the dove-house: 'twas no need, I trow,
579- To bid me trudge:
580- And since that time it is eleven years;
581- For then she could stand alone; nay, by the rood,
582- She could have run and waddled all about;
583- For even the day before, she broke her brow:
584- And then my husband--God be with his soul!
585- A' was a merry man--took up the child:
586- 'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?
587- Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;
588- Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidame,
589- The pretty wretch left crying and said 'Ay.'
590- To see, now, how a jest shall come about!
591- I warrant, an I should live a thousand years,
592- I never should forget it: 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he;
593- And, pretty fool, it stinted and said 'Ay.'
594- LADY CAPULET
595- Enough of this; I pray thee, hold thy peace.
596- Nurse
597- Yes, madam: yet I cannot choose but laugh,
598- To think it should leave crying and say 'Ay.'
599- And yet, I warrant, it had upon its brow
600- A bump as big as a young cockerel's stone;
601- A parlous knock; and it cried bitterly:
602- 'Yea,' quoth my husband,'fall'st upon thy face?
603- Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;
604- Wilt thou not, Jule?' it stinted and said 'Ay.'
605- JULIET
606- And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.
607- Nurse
608- Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace!
609- Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed:
610- An I might live to see thee married once,
611- I have my wish.
612- LADY CAPULET
613- Marry, that 'marry' is the very theme
614- I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,
615- How stands your disposition to be married?
616- JULIET
617- It is an honour that I dream not of.
618- Nurse
619- An honour! were not I thine only nurse,
620- I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat.
621- LADY CAPULET
622- Well, think of marriage now; younger than you,
623- Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,
624- Are made already mothers: by my count,
625- I was your mother much upon these years
626- That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief:
627- The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
628- Nurse
629- A man, young lady! lady, such a man
630- As all the world--why, he's a man of wax.
631- LADY CAPULET
632- Verona's summer hath not such a flower.
633- Nurse
634- Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower.
635- LADY CAPULET
636- What say you? can you love the gentleman?
637- This night you shall behold him at our feast;
638- Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face,
639- And find delight writ there with beauty's pen;
640- Examine every married lineament,
641- And see how one another lends content
642- And what obscured in this fair volume lies
643- Find written in the margent of his eyes.
644- This precious book of love, this unbound lover,
645- To beautify him, only lacks a cover:
646- The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride
647- For fair without the fair within to hide:
648- That book in many's eyes doth share the glory,
649- That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;
650- So shall you share all that he doth possess,
651- By having him, making yourself no less.
652- Nurse
653- No less! nay, bigger; women grow by men.
654- LADY CAPULET
655- Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?
656- JULIET
657- I'll look to like, if looking liking move:
658- But no more deep will I endart mine eye
659- Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.
660- Enter a Servant
661- 
662- Servant
663- Madam, the guests are come, supper served up, you
664- called, my young lady asked for, the nurse cursed in
665- the pantry, and every thing in extremity. I must
666- hence to wait; I beseech you, follow straight.
667- LADY CAPULET
668- We follow thee.
669- Exit Servant
670- 
671- Juliet, the county stays.
672- Nurse
673- Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.
674- Exeunt
675- 
676- SCENE IV. A street.
677- 
678- Enter ROMEO, MERCUTIO, BENVOLIO, with five or six Maskers, Torch-bearers, and others
679- ROMEO
680- What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?
681- Or shall we on without a apology?
682- BENVOLIO
683- The date is out of such prolixity:
684- We'll have no Cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf,
685- Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath,
686- Scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper;
687- Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke
688- After the prompter, for our entrance:
689- But let them measure us by what they will;
690- We'll measure them a measure, and be gone.
691- ROMEO
692- Give me a torch: I am not for this ambling;
693- Being but heavy, I will bear the light.
694- MERCUTIO
695- Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.
696- ROMEO
697- Not I, believe me: you have dancing shoes
698- With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead
699- So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.
700- MERCUTIO
701- You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings,
702- And soar with them above a common bound.
703- ROMEO
704- I am too sore enpierced with his shaft
705- To soar with his light feathers, and so bound,
706- I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe:
707- Under love's heavy burden do I sink.
708- MERCUTIO
709- And, to sink in it, should you burden love;
710- Too great oppression for a tender thing.
711- ROMEO
712- Is love a tender thing? it is too rough,
713- Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.
714- MERCUTIO
715- If love be rough with you, be rough with love;
716- Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.
717- Give me a case to put my visage in:
718- A visor for a visor! what care I
719- What curious eye doth quote deformities?
720- Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me.
721- BENVOLIO
722- Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in,
723- But every man betake him to his legs.
724- ROMEO
725- A torch for me: let wantons light of heart
726- Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels,
727- For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase;
728- I'll be a candle-holder, and look on.
729- The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done.
730- MERCUTIO
731- Tut, dun's the mouse, the constable's own word:
732- If thou art dun, we'll draw thee from the mire
733- Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick'st
734- Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!
735- ROMEO
736- Nay, that's not so.
737- MERCUTIO
738- I mean, sir, in delay
739- We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.
740- Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits
741- Five times in that ere once in our five wits.
742- ROMEO
743- And we mean well in going to this mask;
744- But 'tis no wit to go.
745- MERCUTIO
746- Why, may one ask?
747- ROMEO
748- I dream'd a dream to-night.
749- MERCUTIO
750- And so did I.
751- ROMEO
752- Well, what was yours?
753- MERCUTIO
754- That dreamers often lie.
755- ROMEO
756- In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.
757- MERCUTIO
758- O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.
759- She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes
760- In shape no bigger than an agate-stone
761- On the fore-finger of an alderman,
762- Drawn with a team of little atomies
763- Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;
764- Her wagon-spokes made of long spiders' legs,
765- The cover of the wings of grasshoppers,
766- The traces of the smallest spider's web,
767- The collars of the moonshine's watery beams,
768- Her whip of cricket's bone, the lash of film,
769- Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat,
770- Not so big as a round little worm
771- Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;
772- Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut
773- Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,
774- Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.
775- And in this state she gallops night by night
776- Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;
777- O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on court'sies straight,
778- O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees,
779- O'er ladies ' lips, who straight on kisses dream,
780- Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,
781- Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are:
782- Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,
783- And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;
784- And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail
785- Tickling a parson's nose as a' lies asleep,
786- Then dreams, he of another benefice:
787- Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,
788- And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,
789- Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,
790- Of healths five-fathom deep; and then anon
791- Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,
792- And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two
793- And sleeps again. This is that very Mab
794- That plats the manes of horses in the night,
795- And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs,
796- Which once untangled, much misfortune bodes:
797- This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,
798- That presses them and learns them first to bear,
799- Making them women of good carriage:
800- This is she--
801- ROMEO
802- Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!
803- Thou talk'st of nothing.
804- MERCUTIO
805- True, I talk of dreams,
806- Which are the children of an idle brain,
807- Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,
808- Which is as thin of substance as the air
809- And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes
810- Even now the frozen bosom of the north,
811- And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,
812- Turning his face to the dew-dropping south.
813- BENVOLIO
814- This wind, you talk of, blows us from ourselves;
815- Supper is done, and we shall come too late.
816- ROMEO
817- I fear, too early: for my mind misgives
818- Some consequence yet hanging in the stars
819- Shall bitterly begin his fearful date
820- With this night's revels and expire the term
821- Of a despised life closed in my breast
822- By some vile forfeit of untimely death.
823- But He, that hath the steerage of my course,
824- Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen.
825- BENVOLIO
826- Strike, drum.
827- Exeunt
828- 
829- SCENE V. A hall in Capulet's house.
830- 
831- Musicians waiting. Enter Servingmen with napkins
832- First Servant
833- Where's Potpan, that he helps not to take away? He
834- shift a trencher? he scrape a trencher!
835- Second Servant
836- When good manners shall lie all in one or two men's
837- hands and they unwashed too, 'tis a foul thing.
838- First Servant
839- Away with the joint-stools, remove the
840- court-cupboard, look to the plate. Good thou, save
841- me a piece of marchpane; and, as thou lovest me, let
842- the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell.
843- Antony, and Potpan!
844- Second Servant
845- Ay, boy, ready.
846- First Servant
847- You are looked for and called for, asked for and
848- sought for, in the great chamber.
849- Second Servant
850- We cannot be here and there too. Cheerly, boys; be
851- brisk awhile, and the longer liver take all.
852- Enter CAPULET, with JULIET and others of his house, meeting the Guests and Maskers
853- 
854- CAPULET
855- Welcome, gentlemen! ladies that have their toes
856- Unplagued with corns will have a bout with you.
857- Ah ha, my mistresses! which of you all
858- Will now deny to dance? she that makes dainty,
859- She, I'll swear, hath corns; am I come near ye now?
860- Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day
861- That I have worn a visor and could tell
862- A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear,
863- Such as would please: 'tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone:
864- You are welcome, gentlemen! come, musicians, play.
865- A hall, a hall! give room! and foot it, girls.
866- Music plays, and they dance
867- 
868- More light, you knaves; and turn the tables up,
869- And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot.
870- Ah, sirrah, this unlook'd-for sport comes well.
871- Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet;
872- For you and I are past our dancing days:
873- How long is't now since last yourself and I
874- Were in a mask?
875- Second Capulet
876- By'r lady, thirty years.
877- CAPULET
878- What, man! 'tis not so much, 'tis not so much:
879- 'Tis since the nuptials of Lucentio,
880- Come pentecost as quickly as it will,
881- Some five and twenty years; and then we mask'd.
882- Second Capulet
883- 'Tis more, 'tis more, his son is elder, sir;
884- His son is thirty.
885- CAPULET
886- Will you tell me that?
887- His son was but a ward two years ago.
888- ROMEO
889- [To a Servingman] What lady is that, which doth
890- enrich the hand
891- Of yonder knight?
892- Servant
893- I know not, sir.
894- ROMEO
895- O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!
896- It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
897- Like a rich jewel in an Ethiope's ear;
898- Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!
899- So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows,
900- As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.
901- The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand,
902- And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.
903- Did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight!
904- For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.
905- TYBALT
906- This, by his voice, should be a Montague.
907- Fetch me my rapier, boy. What dares the slave
908- Come hither, cover'd with an antic face,
909- To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?
910- Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,
911- To strike him dead, I hold it not a sin.
912- CAPULET
913- Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?
914- TYBALT
915- Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe,
916- A villain that is hither come in spite,
917- To scorn at our solemnity this night.
918- CAPULET
919- Young Romeo is it?
920- TYBALT
921- 'Tis he, that villain Romeo.
922- CAPULET
923- Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone;
924- He bears him like a portly gentleman;
925- And, to say truth, Verona brags of him
926- To be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth:
927- I would not for the wealth of all the town
928- Here in my house do him disparagement:
929- Therefore be patient, take no note of him:
930- It is my will, the which if thou respect,
931- Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,
932- And ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.
933- TYBALT
934- It fits, when such a villain is a guest:
935- I'll not endure him.
936- CAPULET
937- He shall be endured:
938- What, goodman boy! I say, he shall: go to;
939- Am I the master here, or you? go to.
940- You'll not endure him! God shall mend my soul!
941- You'll make a mutiny among my guests!
942- You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man!
943- TYBALT
944- Why, uncle, 'tis a shame.
945- CAPULET
946- Go to, go to;
947- You are a saucy boy: is't so, indeed?
948- This trick may chance to scathe you, I know what:
949- You must contrary me! marry, 'tis time.
950- Well said, my hearts! You are a princox; go:
951- Be quiet, or--More light, more light! For shame!
952- I'll make you quiet. What, cheerly, my hearts!
953- TYBALT
954- Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting
955- Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.
956- I will withdraw: but this intrusion shall
957- Now seeming sweet convert to bitter gall.
958- Exit
959- 
960- ROMEO
961- [To JULIET] If I profane with my unworthiest hand
962- This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this:
963- My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand
964- To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.
965- JULIET
966- Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,
967- Which mannerly devotion shows in this;
968- For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,
969- And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
970- ROMEO
971- Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
972- JULIET
973- Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
974- ROMEO
975- O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do;
976- They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
977- JULIET
978- Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.
979- ROMEO
980- Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take.
981- Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged.
982- JULIET
983- Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
984- ROMEO
985- Sin from thy lips? O trespass sweetly urged!
986- Give me my sin again.
987- JULIET
988- You kiss by the book.
989- Nurse
990- Madam, your mother craves a word with you.
991- ROMEO
992- What is her mother?
993- Nurse
994- Marry, bachelor,
995- Her mother is the lady of the house,
996- And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous
997- I nursed her daughter, that you talk'd withal;
998- I tell you, he that can lay hold of her
999- Shall have the chinks.
1000- ROMEO
1001- Is she a Capulet?
1002- O dear account! my life is my foe's debt.
1003- BENVOLIO
1004- Away, begone; the sport is at the best.
1005- ROMEO
1006- Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.
1007- CAPULET
1008- Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone;
1009- We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.
1010- Is it e'en so? why, then, I thank you all
1011- I thank you, honest gentlemen; good night.
1012- More torches here! Come on then, let's to bed.
1013- Ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late:
1014- I'll to my rest.
1015- Exeunt all but JULIET and Nurse
1016- 
1017- JULIET
1018- Come hither, nurse. What is yond gentleman?
1019- Nurse
1020- The son and heir of old Tiberio.
1021- JULIET
1022- What's he that now is going out of door?
1023- Nurse
1024- Marry, that, I think, be young Petrucio.
1025- JULIET
1026- What's he that follows there, that would not dance?
1027- Nurse
1028- I know not.
1029- JULIET
1030- Go ask his name: if he be married.
1031- My grave is like to be my wedding bed.
1032- Nurse
1033- His name is Romeo, and a Montague;
1034- The only son of your great enemy.
1035- JULIET
1036- My only love sprung from my only hate!
1037- Too early seen unknown, and known too late!
1038- Prodigious birth of love it is to me,
1039- That I must love a loathed enemy.
1040- Nurse
1041- What's this? what's this?
1042- JULIET
1043- A rhyme I learn'd even now
1044- Of one I danced withal.
1045- One calls within 'Juliet.'
1046- 
1047- Nurse
1048- Anon, anon!
1049- Come, let's away; the strangers all are gone.

1056- Enter Chorus
1057- Chorus
1058- Now old desire doth in his death-bed lie,
1059- And young affection gapes to be his heir;
1060- That fair for which love groan'd for and would die,
1061- With tender Juliet match'd, is now not fair.
1062- Now Romeo is beloved and loves again,
1063- Alike betwitched by the charm of looks,
1064- But to his foe supposed he must complain,
1065- And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks:
1066- Being held a foe, he may not have access
1067- To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear;
1068- And she as much in love, her means much less
1069- To meet her new-beloved any where:
1070- But passion lends them power, time means, to meet
1071- Tempering extremities with extreme sweet.

1090- He ran this way, and leap'd this orchard wall:
1091- Call, good Mercutio.
1092- MERCUTIO
1093- Nay, I'll conjure too.
1094- Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover!
1095- Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh:
1096- Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied;
1097- Cry but 'Ay me!' pronounce but 'love' and 'dove;'
1098- Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,
1099- One nick-name for her purblind son and heir,
1100- Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim,
1101- When King Cophetua loved the beggar-maid!
1102- He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not;
1103- The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.
1104- I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes,
1105- By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,
1106- By her fine foot, straight leg and quivering thigh
1107- And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,
1108- That in thy likeness thou appear to us!
1109- BENVOLIO
1110- And if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.
1111- MERCUTIO
1112- This cannot anger him: 'twould anger him
1113- To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle
1114- Of some strange nature, letting it there stand
1115- Till she had laid it and conjured it down;
1116- That were some spite: my invocation
1117- Is fair and honest, and in his mistres s' name
1118- I conjure only but to raise up him.
1119- BENVOLIO
1120- Come, he hath hid himself among these trees,
1121- To be consorted with the humorous night:
1122- Blind is his love and best befits the dark.
1123- MERCUTIO
1124- If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.
1125- Now will he sit under a medlar tree,
1126- And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit
1127- As maids call medlars, when they laugh alone.
1128- Romeo, that she were, O, that she were
1129- An open et caetera, thou a poperin pear!
1130- Romeo, good night: I'll to my truckle-bed;
1131- This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep:
1132- Come, shall we go?
1133- BENVOLIO
1134- Go, then; for 'tis in vain
1135- To seek him here that means not to be found.
1136- Exeunt
1137- 
1138- SCENE II. Capulet's orchard.
1139- 
1140- Enter ROMEO
1141- ROMEO
1142- He jests at scars that never felt a wound.
1143- JULIET appears above at a window
1144- 
1145- But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?
1146- It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.
1147- Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
1148- Who is already sick and pale with grief,
1149- That thou her maid art far more fair than she:
1150- Be not her maid, since she is envious;
1151- Her vestal livery is but sick and green
1152- And none but fools do wear it; cast it off.
1153- It is my lady, O, it is my love!
1154- O, that she knew she were!
1155- She speaks yet she says nothing: what of that?
1156- Her eye discourses; I will answer it.
1157- I am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks:
1158- Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,
1159- Having some business, do entreat her eyes
1160- To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
1161- What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
1162- The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,
1163- As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven
1164- Would through the airy region stream so bright
1165- That birds would sing and think it were not night.
1166- See, how she leans her cheek upon her hand!
1167- O, that I were a glove upon that hand,
1168- That I might touch that cheek!
1169- JULIET
1170- Ay me!
1171- ROMEO
1172- She speaks:
1173- O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art
1174- As glorious to this night, being o'er my head
1175- As is a winged messenger of heaven
1176- Unto the white-upturned wondering eyes
1177- Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
1178- When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds
1179- And sails upon the bosom of the air.
1180- JULIET
1181- O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?
1182- Deny thy father and refuse thy name;
1183- Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
1184- And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
1185- ROMEO
1186- [Aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
1187- JULIET
1188- 'Tis but thy name that is my enemy;
1189- Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
1190- What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,
1191- Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
1192- Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!
1193- What's in a name? that which we call a rose
1194- By any other name would smell as sweet;
1195- So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,
1196- Retain that dear perfection which he owes
1197- Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,
1198- And for that name which is no part of thee
1199- Take all myself.
1200- ROMEO
1201- I take thee at thy word:
1202- Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized;
1203- Henceforth I never will be Romeo.
1204- JULIET
1205- What man art thou that thus bescreen'd in night
1206- So stumblest on my counsel?
1207- ROMEO
1208- By a name
1209- I know not how to tell thee who I am:
1210- My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,
1211- Because it is an enemy to thee;
1212- Had I it written, I would tear the word.
1213- JULIET
1214- My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words
1215- Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound:
1216- Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?
1217- ROMEO
1218- Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.
1219- JULIET
1220- How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
1221- The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,
1222- And the place death, considering who thou art,
1223- If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
1224- ROMEO
1225- With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls;
1226- For stony limits cannot hold love out,
1227- And what love can do that dares love attempt;
1228- Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.
1229- JULIET
1230- If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
1231- ROMEO
1232- Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye
1233- Than twenty of their swords: look thou but sweet,
1234- And I am proof against their enmity.
1235- JULIET
1236- I would not for the world they saw thee here.
1237- ROMEO
1238- I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;
1239- And but thou love me, let them find me here:
1240- My life were better ended by their hate,
1241- Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
1242- JULIET
1243- By whose direction found'st thou out this place?
1244- ROMEO
1245- By love, who first did prompt me to inquire;
1246- He lent me counsel and I lent him eyes.
1247- I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far
1248- As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,
1249- I would adventure for such merchandise.
1250- JULIET
1251- Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face,
1252- Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
1253- For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night
1254- Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny
1255- What I have spoke: but farewell compliment!
1256- Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,'
1257- And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st,
1258- Thou mayst prove false; at lovers' perjuries
1259- Then say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,
1260- If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:
1261- Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won,
1262- I'll frown and be perverse an say thee nay,
1263- So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.
1264- In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,
1265- And therefore thou mayst think my 'havior light:
1266- But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true
1267- Than those that have more cunning to be strange.
1268- I should have been more strange, I must confess,
1269- But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,
1270- My true love's passion: therefore pardon me,
1271- And not impute this yielding to light love,
1272- Which the dark night hath so discovered.
1273- ROMEO
1274- Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear
1275- That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--
1276- JULIET
1277- O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon,
1278- That monthly changes in her circled orb,
1279- Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
1280- ROMEO
1281- What shall I swear by?
1282- JULIET
1283- Do not swear at all;
1284- Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
1285- Which is the god of my idolatry,
1286- And I'll believe thee.
1287- ROMEO
1288- If my heart's dear love--
1289- JULIET
1290- Well, do not swear: although I joy in thee,
1291- I have no joy of this contract to-night:
1292- It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;
1293- Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
1294- Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!
1295- This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,
1296- May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.
1297- Good night, good night! as sweet repose and rest
1298- Come to thy heart as that within my breast!
1299- ROMEO
1300- O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
1301- JULIET
1302- What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
1303- ROMEO
1304- The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
1305- JULIET
1306- I gave thee mine before thou didst request it:
1307- And yet I would it were to give again.
1308- ROMEO
1309- Wouldst thou withdraw it? for what purpose, love?
1310- JULIET
1311- But to be frank, and give it thee again.
1312- And yet I wish but for the thing I have:
1313- My bounty is as boundless as the sea,
1314- My love as deep; the more I give to thee,
1315- The more I have, for both are infinite.
1316- Nurse calls within
1317- 
1318- I hear some noise within; dear love, adieu!
1319- Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.
1320- Stay but a little, I will come again.
1321- Exit, above
1322- 
1323- ROMEO
1324- O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard.
1325- Being in night, all this is but a dream,
1326- Too flattering-sweet to be substantial.
1327- Re-enter JULIET, above
1328- 
1329- JULIET
1330- Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.
1331- If that thy bent of love be honourable,
1332- Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,
1333- By one that I'll procure to come to thee,
1334- Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite;
1335- And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay
1336- And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
1337- Nurse
1338- [Within] Madam!
1339- JULIET
1340- I come, anon.--But if thou mean'st not well,
1341- I do beseech thee--
1342- Nurse
1343- [Within] Madam!
1344- JULIET
1345- By and by, I come:--
1346- To cease thy suit, and leave me to my grief:
1347- To-morrow will I send.
1348- ROMEO
1349- So thrive my soul--
1350- JULIET
1351- A thousand times good night!
1352- Exit, above
1353- 
1354- ROMEO
1355- A thousand times the worse, to want thy light.
1356- Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from
1357- their books,
1358- But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.
1359- Retiring
1360- 
1361- Re-enter JULIET, above
1362- 
1363- JULIET
1364- Hist! Romeo, hist! O, for a falconer's voice,
1365- To lure this tassel-gentle back again!
1366- Bondage is hoarse, and may not speak aloud;
1367- Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,
1368- And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine,
1369- With repetition of my Romeo's name.
1370- ROMEO
1371- It is my soul that calls upon my name:
1372- How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,
1373- Like softest music to attending ears!
1374- JULIET
1375- Romeo!
1376- ROMEO
1377- My dear?
1378- JULIET
1379- At what o'clock to-morrow
1380- Shall I send to thee?
1381- ROMEO
1382- At the hour of nine.
1383- JULIET
1384- I will not fail: 'tis twenty years till then.
1385- I have forgot why I did call thee back.
1386- ROMEO
1387- Let me stand here till thou remember it.
1388- JULIET
1389- I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,
1390- Remembering how I love thy company.
1391- ROMEO
1392- And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,
1393- Forgetting any other home but this.
1394- JULIET
1395- 'Tis almost morning; I would have thee gone:
1396- And yet no further than a wanton's bird;
1397- Who lets it hop a little from her hand,
1398- Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,
1399- And with a silk thread plucks it back again,
1400- So loving-jealous of his liberty.
1401- ROMEO
1402- I would I were thy bird.
1403- JULIET
1404- Sweet, so would I:
1405- Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.
1406- Good night, good night! parting is such
1407- sweet sorrow,
1408- That I shall say good night till it be morrow.
1409- Exit above
1410- 
1411- ROMEO
1412- Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast!
1413- Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest!
1414- Hence will I to my ghostly father's cell,
1415- His help to crave, and my dear hap to tell.
1416- Exit
1417- 
1418- SCENE III. Friar Laurence's cell.
1419- 
1420- Enter FRIAR LAURENCE, with a basket
1421- FRIAR LAURENCE
1422- The grey-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night,
1423- Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light,
1424- And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels
1425- From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels:
1426- Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye,
1427- The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,
1428- I must up-fill this osier cage of ours
1429- With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.
1430- The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb;
1431- What is her burying grave that is her womb,
1432- And from her womb children of divers kind
1433- We sucking on her natural bosom find,
1434- Many for many virtues excellent,
1435- None but for some and yet all different.
1436- O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies
1437- In herbs, plants, stones, and their true qualities:
1438- For nought so vile that on the earth doth live
1439- But to the earth some special good doth give,
1440- Nor aught so good but strain'd from that fair use
1441- Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse:
1442- Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied;
1443- And vice sometimes by action dignified.
1444- Within the infant rind of this small flower
1445- Poison hath residence and medicine power:
1446- For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;
1447- Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.
1448- Two such opposed kings encamp them still
1449- In man as well as herbs, grace and rude will;
1450- And where the worser is predominant,
1451- Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.
1452- Enter ROMEO
1453- 
1454- ROMEO
1455- Good morrow, father.
1456- FRIAR LAURENCE
1457- Benedicite!
1458- What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?
1459- Young son, it argues a distemper'd head
1460- So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed:
1461- Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye,
1462- And where care lodges, sleep will never lie;
1463- But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain
1464- Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign:
1465- Therefore thy earliness doth me assure
1466- Thou art up-roused by some distemperature;
1467- Or if not so, then here I hit it right,
1468- Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.
1469- ROMEO
1470- That last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.
1471- FRIAR LAURENCE
1472- God pardon sin! wast thou with Rosaline?
1473- ROMEO
1474- With Rosaline, my ghostly father? no;
1475- I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.
1476- FRIAR LAURENCE
1477- That's my good son: but where hast thou been, then?
1478- ROMEO
1479- I'll tell thee, ere thou ask it me again.
1480- I have been feasting with mine enemy,
1481- Where on a sudden one hath wounded me,
1482- That's by me wounded: both our remedies
1483- Within thy help and holy physic lies:
1484- I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo,
1485- My intercession likewise steads my foe.
1486- FRIAR LAURENCE
1487- Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift;
1488- Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
1489- ROMEO
1490- Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set
1491- On the fair daughter of rich Capulet:
1492- As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine;
1493- And all combined, save what thou must combine
1494- By holy marriage: when and where and how
1495- We met, we woo'd and made exchange of vow,
1496- I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,
1497- That thou consent to marry us to-day.
1498- FRIAR LAURENCE
1499- Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here!
1500- Is Rosaline, whom thou didst love so dear,
1501- So soon forsaken? young men's love then lies
1502- Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.
1503- Jesu Maria, what a deal of brine
1504- Hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!
1505- How much salt water thrown away in waste,
1506- To season love, that of it doth not taste!
1507- The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,
1508- Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears;
1509- Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit
1510- Of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet:
1511- If e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine,
1512- Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline:
1513- And art thou changed? pronounce this sentence then,
1514- Women may fall, when there's no strength in men.
1515- ROMEO
1516- Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.
1517- FRIAR LAURENCE
1518- For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.
1519- ROMEO
1520- And bad'st me bury love.
1521- FRIAR LAURENCE
1522- Not in a grave,
1523- To lay one in, another out to have.
1524- ROMEO
1525- I pray thee, chide not; she whom I love now
1526- Doth grace for grace and love for love allow;
1527- The other did not so.
1528- FRIAR LAURENCE
1529- O, she knew well
1530- Thy love did read by rote and could not spell.
1531- But come, young waverer, come, go with me,
1532- In one respect I'll thy assistant be;
1533- For this alliance may so happy prove,
1534- To turn your households' rancour to pure love.
1535- ROMEO
1536- O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.
1537- FRIAR LAURENCE
1538- Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.
1539- Exeunt
1540- 
1541- SCENE IV. A street.
1542- 
1543- Enter BENVOLIO and MERCUTIO
1544- MERCUTIO
1545- Where the devil should this Romeo be?
1546- Came he not home to-night?
1547- BENVOLIO
1548- Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.
1549- MERCUTIO
1550- Ah, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline.
1551- Torments him so, that he will sure run mad.
1552- BENVOLIO
1553- Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet,
1554- Hath sent a letter to his father's house.
1555- MERCUTIO
1556- A challenge, on my life.
1557- BENVOLIO
1558- Romeo will answer it.
1559- MERCUTIO
1560- Any man that can write may answer a letter.
1561- BENVOLIO
1562- Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he
1563- dares, being dared.
1564- MERCUTIO
1565- Alas poor Romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a
1566- white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a
1567- love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the
1568- blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to
1569- encounter Tybalt?
1570- BENVOLIO
1571- Why, what is Tybalt?
1572- MERCUTIO
1573- More than prince of cats, I can tell you. O, he is
1574- the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as
1575- you sing prick-song, keeps time, distance, and
1576- proportion; rests me his minim rest, one, two, and
1577- the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk
1578- button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of the
1579- very first house, of the first and second cause:
1580- ah, the immortal passado! the punto reverso! the
1581- hai!
1582- BENVOLIO
1583- The what?
1584- MERCUTIO
1585- The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting
1586- fantasticoes; these new tuners of accents! 'By Jesu,
1587- a very good blade! a very tall man! a very good
1588- whore!' Why, is not this a lamentable thing,
1589- grandsire, that we should be thus afflicted with
1590- these strange flies, these fashion-mongers, these
1591- perdona-mi's, who stand so much on the new form,
1592- that they cannot at ease on the old bench? O, their
1593- bones, their bones!
1594- Enter ROMEO
1595- 
1596- BENVOLIO
1597- Here comes Romeo, here comes Romeo.
1598- MERCUTIO
1599- Without his roe, like a dried herring: flesh, flesh,
1600- how art thou fishified! Now is he for the numbers
1601- that Petrarch flowed in: Laura to his lady was but a
1602- kitchen-wench; marry, she had a better love to
1603- be-rhyme her; Dido a dowdy; Cleopatra a gipsy;
1604- Helen and Hero hildings and harlots; Thisbe a grey
1605- eye or so, but not to the purpose. Signior
1606- Romeo, bon jour! there's a French salutation
1607- to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit
1608- fairly last night.
1609- ROMEO
1610- Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?
1611- MERCUTIO
1612- The ship, sir, the slip; can you not conceive?
1613- ROMEO
1614- Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great; and in
1615- such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy.
1616- MERCUTIO
1617- That's as much as to say, such a case as yours
1618- constrains a man to bow in the hams.
1619- ROMEO
1620- Meaning, to court'sy.
1621- MERCUTIO
1622- Thou hast most kindly hit it.
1623- ROMEO
1624- A most courteous exposition.
1625- MERCUTIO
1626- Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.
1627- ROMEO
1628- Pink for flower.
1629- MERCUTIO
1630- Right.
1631- ROMEO
1632- Why, then is my pump well flowered.
1633- MERCUTIO
1634- Well said: follow me this jest now till thou hast
1635- worn out thy pump, that when the single sole of it
1636- is worn, the jest may remain after the wearing sole singular.
1637- ROMEO
1638- O single-soled jest, solely singular for the
1639- singleness.
1640- MERCUTIO
1641- Come between us, good Benvolio; my wits faint.
1642- ROMEO
1643- Switch and spurs, switch and spurs; or I'll cry a match.
1644- MERCUTIO
1645- Nay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chase, I have
1646- done, for thou hast more of the wild-goose in one of
1647- thy wits than, I am sure, I have in my whole five:
1648- was I with you there for the goose?
1649- ROMEO
1650- Thou wast never with me for any thing when thou wast
1651- not there for the goose.
1652- MERCUTIO
1653- I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.
1654- ROMEO
1655- Nay, good goose, bite not.
1656- MERCUTIO
1657- Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most
1658- sharp sauce.
1659- ROMEO
1660- And is it not well served in to a sweet goose?
1661- MERCUTIO
1662- O here's a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an
1663- inch narrow to an ell broad!
1664- ROMEO
1665- I stretch it out for that word 'broad;' which added
1666- to the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose.
1667- MERCUTIO
1668- Why, is not this better now than groaning for love?
1669- now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art
1670- thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature:
1671- for this drivelling love is like a great natural,
1672- that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole.
1673- BENVOLIO
1674- Stop there, stop there.
1675- MERCUTIO
1676- Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.
1677- BENVOLIO
1678- Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.
1679- MERCUTIO
1680- O, thou art deceived; I would have made it short:
1681- for I was come to the whole depth of my tale; and
1682- meant, indeed, to occupy the argument no longer.
1683- ROMEO
1684- Here's goodly gear!
1685- Enter Nurse and PETER
1686- 
1687- MERCUTIO
1688- A sail, a sail!
1689- BENVOLIO
1690- Two, two; a shirt and a smock.
1691- Nurse
1692- Peter!
1693- PETER
1694- Anon!
1695- Nurse
1696- My fan, Peter.
1697- MERCUTIO
1698- Good Peter, to hide her face; for her fan's the
1699- fairer face.
1700- Nurse
1701- God ye good morrow, gentlemen.
1702- MERCUTIO
1703- God ye good den, fair gentlewoman.
1704- Nurse
1705- Is it good den?
1706- MERCUTIO
1707- 'Tis no less, I tell you, for the bawdy hand of the
1708- dial is now upon the prick of noon.
1709- Nurse
1710- Out upon you! what a man are you!
1711- ROMEO
1712- One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to
1713- mar.
1714- Nurse
1715- By my troth, it is well said; 'for himself to mar,'
1716- quoth a'? Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I
1717- may find the young Romeo?
1718- ROMEO
1719- I can tell you; but young Romeo will be older when
1720- you have found him than he was when you sought him:
1721- I am the youngest of that name, for fault of a worse.
1722- Nurse
1723- You say well.
1724- MERCUTIO
1725- Yea, is the worst well? very well took, i' faith;
1726- wisely, wisely.
1727- Nurse
1728- if you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with
1729- you.
1730- BENVOLIO
1731- She will indite him to some supper.
1732- MERCUTIO
1733- A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! so ho!
1734- ROMEO
1735- What hast thou found?
1736- MERCUTIO
1737- No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie,
1738- that is something stale and hoar ere it be spent.
1739- Sings
1740- 
1741- An old hare hoar,
1742- And an old hare hoar,
1743- Is very good meat in lent
1744- But a hare that is hoar
1745- Is too much for a score,
1746- When it hoars ere it be spent.
1747- Romeo, will you come to your father's? we'll
1748- to dinner, thither.
1749- ROMEO
1750- I will follow you.
1751- MERCUTIO
1752- Farewell, ancient lady; farewell,
1753- Singing
1754- 
1755- 'lady, lady, lady.'
1756- Exeunt MERCUTIO and BENVOLIO
1757- 
1758- Nurse
1759- Marry, farewell! I pray you, sir, what saucy
1760- merchant was this, that was so full of his ropery?
1761- ROMEO
1762- A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk,
1763- and will speak more in a minute than he will stand
1764- to in a month.
1765- Nurse
1766- An a' speak any thing against me, I'll take him
1767- down, an a' were lustier than he is, and twenty such
1768- Jacks; and if I cannot, I'll find those that shall.
1769- Scurvy knave! I am none of his flirt-gills; I am
1770- none of his skains-mates. And thou must stand by
1771- too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure?
1772- PETER
1773- I saw no man use you a pleasure; if I had, my weapon
1774- should quickly have been out, I warrant you: I dare
1775- draw as soon as another man, if I see occasion in a
1776- good quarrel, and the law on my side.
1777- Nurse
1778- Now, afore God, I am so vexed, that every part about
1779- me quivers. Scurvy knave! Pray you, sir, a word:
1780- and as I told you, my young lady bade me inquire you
1781- out; what she bade me say, I will keep to myself:
1782- but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead her into
1783- a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross
1784- kind of behavior, as they say: for the gentlewoman
1785- is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double
1786- with her, truly it were an ill thing to be offered
1787- to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing.
1788- ROMEO
1789- Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I
1790- protest unto thee--
1791- Nurse
1792- Good heart, and, i' faith, I will tell her as much:
1793- Lord, Lord, she will be a joyful woman.
1794- ROMEO
1795- What wilt thou tell her, nurse? thou dost not mark me.
1796- Nurse
1797- I will tell her, sir, that you do protest; which, as
1798- I take it, is a gentlemanlike offer.
1799- ROMEO
1800- Bid her devise
1801- Some means to come to shrift this afternoon;
1802- And there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell
1803- Be shrived and married. Here is for thy pains.
1804- Nurse
1805- No truly sir; not a penny.
1806- ROMEO
1807- Go to; I say you shall.
1808- Nurse
1809- This afternoon, sir? well, she shall be there.
1810- ROMEO
1811- And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall:
1812- Within this hour my man shall be with thee
1813- And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair;
1814- Which to the high top-gallant of my joy
1815- Must be my convoy in the secret night.
1816- Farewell; be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains:
1817- Farewell; commend me to thy mistress.
1818- Nurse
1819- Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.
1820- ROMEO
1821- What say'st thou, my dear nurse?
1822- Nurse
1823- Is your man secret? Did you ne'er hear say,
1824- Two may keep counsel, putting one away?
1825- ROMEO
1826- I warrant thee, my man's as true as steel.
1827- NURSE
1828- Well, sir; my mistress is the sweetest lady--Lord,
1829- Lord! when 'twas a little prating thing:--O, there
1830- is a nobleman in town, one Paris, that would fain
1831- lay knife aboard; but she, good soul, had as lief
1832- see a toad, a very toad, as see him. I anger her
1833- sometimes and tell her that Paris is the properer
1834- man; but, I'll warrant you, when I say so, she looks
1835- as pale as any clout in the versal world. Doth not
1836- rosemary and Romeo begin both with a letter?
1837- ROMEO
1838- Ay, nurse; what of that? both with an R.
1839- Nurse
1840- Ah. mocker! that's the dog's name; R is for
1841- the--No; I know it begins with some other
1842- letter:--and she hath the prettiest sententious of
1843- it, of you and rosemary, that it would do you good
1844- to hear it.
1845- ROMEO
1846- Commend me to thy lady.
1847- Nurse
1848- Ay, a thousand times.
1849- Exit Romeo
1850- 
1851- Peter!
1852- PETER
1853- Anon!
1854- Nurse
1855- Peter, take my fan, and go before and apace.
1856- Exeunt
1857- 
1858- SCENE V. Capulet's orchard.
1859- 
1860- Enter JULIET
1861- JULIET
1862- The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse;
1863- In half an hour she promised to return.
1864- Perchance she cannot meet him: that's not so.
1865- O, she is lame! love's heralds should be thoughts,
1866- Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams,
1867- Driving back shadows over louring hills:
1868- Therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw love,
1869- And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.
1870- Now is the sun upon the highmost hill
1871- Of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve
1872- Is three long hours, yet she is not come.
1873- Had she affections and warm youthful blood,
1874- She would be as swift in motion as a ball;
1875- My words would bandy her to my sweet love,
1876- And his to me:
1877- But old folks, many feign as they were dead;
1878- Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.
1879- O God, she comes!
1880- Enter Nurse and PETER
1881- 
1882- O honey nurse, what news?
1883- Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away.
1884- Nurse
1885- Peter, stay at the gate.
1886- Exit PETER
1887- 
1888- JULIET
1889- Now, good sweet nurse,--O Lord, why look'st thou sad?
1890- Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;
1891- If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news
1892- By playing it to me with so sour a face.
1893- Nurse
1894- I am a-weary, give me leave awhile:
1895- Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I had!
1896- JULIET
1897- I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news:
1898- Nay, come, I pray thee, speak; good, good nurse, speak.
1899- Nurse
1900- Jesu, what haste? can you not stay awhile?
1901- Do you not see that I am out of breath?
1902- JULIET
1903- How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath
1904- To say to me that thou art out of breath?
1905- The excuse that thou dost make in this delay
1906- Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.
1907- Is thy news good, or bad? answer to that;
1908- Say either, and I'll stay the circumstance:
1909- Let me be satisfied, is't good or bad?
1910- Nurse
1911- Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not
1912- how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his
1913- face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels
1914- all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,
1915- though they be not to be talked on, yet they are
1916- past compare: he is not the flower of courtesy,
1917- but, I'll warrant him, as gentle as a lamb. Go thy
1918- ways, wench; serve God. What, have you dined at home?
1919- JULIET
1920- No, no: but all this did I know before.
1921- What says he of our marriage? what of that?
1922- Nurse
1923- Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I!
1924- It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.
1925- My back o' t' other side,--O, my back, my back!
1926- Beshrew your heart for sending me about,
1927- To catch my death with jaunting up and down!
1928- JULIET
1929- I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.
1930- Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?
1931- Nurse
1932- Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a
1933- courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I
1934- warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your mother?
1935- JULIET
1936- Where is my mother! why, she is within;
1937- Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest!
1938- 'Your love says, like an honest gentleman,
1939- Where is your mother?'
1940- Nurse
1941- O God's lady dear!
1942- Are you so hot? marry, come up, I trow;
1943- Is this the poultice for my aching bones?
1944- Henceforward do your messages yourself.
1945- JULIET
1946- Here's such a coil! come, what says Romeo?
1947- Nurse
1948- Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day?
1949- JULIET
1950- I have.
1951- Nurse
1952- Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence' cell;
1953- There stays a husband to make you a wife:
1954- Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks,
1955- They'll be in scarlet straight at any news.
1956- Hie you to church; I must another way,
1957- To fetch a ladder, by the which your love
1958- Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark:
1959- I am the drudge and toil in your delight,
1960- But you shall bear the burden soon at night.
1961- Go; I'll to dinner: hie you to the cell.
1962- JULIET
1963- Hie to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewell.
1964- Exeunt
1965- 
1966- SCENE VI. Friar Laurence's cell.
1967- 
1968- Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and ROMEO
1969- FRIAR LAURENCE
1970- So smile the heavens upon this holy act,
1971- That after hours with sorrow chide us not!
1972- ROMEO
1973- Amen, amen! but come what sorrow can,
1974- It cannot countervail the exchange of joy
1975- That one short minute gives me in her sight:
1976- Do thou but close our hands with holy words,
1977- Then love-devouring death do what he dare;
1978- It is enough I may but call her mine.
1979- FRIAR LAURENCE
1980- These violent delights have violent ends
1981- And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,
1982- Which as they kiss consume: the sweetest honey
1983- Is loathsome in his own deliciousness
1984- And in the taste confounds the appetite:
1985- Therefore love moderately; long love doth so;
1986- Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.
1987- Enter JULIET
1988- 
1989- Here comes the lady: O, so light a foot
1990- Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint:
1991- A lover may bestride the gossamer
1992- That idles in the wanton summer air,
1993- And yet not fall; so light is vanity.
1994- JULIET
1995- Good even to my ghostly confessor.
1996- FRIAR LAURENCE
1997- Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.
1998- JULIET
1999- As much to him, else is his thanks too much.
2000- ROMEO
2001- Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy
2002- Be heap'd like mine and that thy skill be more
2003- To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath
2004- This neighbour air, and let rich music's tongue
2005- Unfold the imagined happiness that both
2006- Receive in either by this dear encounter.
2007- JULIET
2008- Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,
2009- Brags of his substance, not of ornament:
2010- They are but beggars that can count their worth;
2011- But my true love is grown to such excess
2012- I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.
2013- FRIAR LAURENCE
2014- Come, come with me, and we will make short work;
2015- For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone
2016- Till holy church incorporate two in one.
2017- Exeunt
2018- 
2019- ACT III
2020- 
2021- SCENE I. A public place.
2022- 
2023- Enter MERCUTIO, BENVOLIO, Page, and Servants
2024- BENVOLIO
2025- I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire:
2026- The day is hot, the Capulets abroad,
2027- And, if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl;
2028- For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.
2029- MERCUTIO
2030- Thou art like one of those fellows that when he
2031- enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword
2032- upon the table and says 'God send me no need of
2033- thee!' and by the operation of the second cup draws
2034- it on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.
2035- BENVOLIO
2036- Am I like such a fellow?
2037- MERCUTIO
2038- Come, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as
2039- any in Italy, and as soon moved to be moody, and as
2040- soon moody to be moved.
2041- BENVOLIO
2042- And what to?
2043- MERCUTIO
2044- Nay, an there were two such, we should have none
2045- shortly, for one would kill the other. Thou! why,
2046- thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more,
2047- or a hair less, in his beard, than thou hast: thou
2048- wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no
2049- other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes: what
2050- eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?
2051- Thy head is as fun of quarrels as an egg is full of
2052- meat, and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as
2053- an egg for quarrelling: thou hast quarrelled with a
2054- man for coughing in the street, because he hath
2055- wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun:
2056- didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing
2057- his new doublet before Easter? with another, for
2058- tying his new shoes with old riband? and yet thou
2059- wilt tutor me from quarrelling!
2060- BENVOLIO
2061- An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man
2062- should buy the fee-simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.
2063- MERCUTIO
2064- The fee-simple! O simple!
2065- BENVOLIO
2066- By my head, here come the Capulets.
2067- MERCUTIO
2068- By my heel, I care not.
2069- Enter TYBALT and others
2070- 
2071- TYBALT
2072- Follow me close, for I will speak to them.
2073- Gentlemen, good den: a word with one of you.
2074- MERCUTIO
2075- And but one word with one of us? couple it with
2076- something; make it a word and a blow.
2077- TYBALT
2078- You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you
2079- will give me occasion.
2080- MERCUTIO
2081- Could you not take some occasion without giving?
2082- TYBALT
2083- Mercutio, thou consort'st with Romeo,--
2084- MERCUTIO
2085- Consort! what, dost thou make us minstrels? an
2086- thou make minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but
2087- discords: here's my fiddlestick; here's that shall
2088- make you dance. 'Zounds, consort!
2089- BENVOLIO
2090- We talk here in the public haunt of men:
2091- Either withdraw unto some private place,
2092- And reason coldly of your grievances,
2093- Or else depart; here all eyes gaze on us.
2094- MERCUTIO
2095- Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze;
2096- I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.
2097- Enter ROMEO
2098- 
2099- TYBALT
2100- Well, peace be with you, sir: here comes my man.
2101- MERCUTIO
2102- But I'll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery:
2103- Marry, go before to field, he'll be your follower;
2104- Your worship in that sense may call him 'man.'
2105- TYBALT
2106- Romeo, the hate I bear thee can afford
2107- No better term than this,--thou art a villain.
2108- ROMEO
2109- Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee
2110- Doth much excuse the appertaining rage
2111- To such a greeting: villain am I none;
2112- Therefore farewell; I see thou know'st me not.
2113- TYBALT
2114- Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries
2115- That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw.
2116- ROMEO
2117- I do protest, I never injured thee,
2118- But love thee better than thou canst devise,
2119- Till thou shalt know the reason of my love:
2120- And so, good Capulet,--which name I tender
2121- As dearly as my own,--be satisfied.
2122- MERCUTIO
2123- O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!
2124- Alla stoccata carries it away.
2125- Draws
2126- 
2127- Tybalt, you rat-catcher, will you walk?
2128- TYBALT
2129- What wouldst thou have with me?
2130- MERCUTIO
2131- Good king of cats, nothing but one of your nine
2132- lives; that I mean to make bold withal, and as you
2133- shall use me hereafter, drybeat the rest of the
2134- eight. Will you pluck your sword out of his pitcher
2135- by the ears? make haste, lest mine be about your
2136- ears ere it be out.
2137- TYBALT
2138- I am for you.
2139- Drawing
2140- 
2141- ROMEO
2142- Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.
2143- MERCUTIO
2144- Come, sir, your passado.
2145- They fight
2146- 
2147- ROMEO
2148- Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.
2149- Gentlemen, for shame, forbear this outrage!
2150- Tybalt, Mercutio, the prince expressly hath
2151- Forbidden bandying in Verona streets:
2152- Hold, Tybalt! good Mercutio!
2153- TYBALT under ROMEO's arm stabs MERCUTIO, and flies with his followers
2154- 
2155- MERCUTIO
2156- I am hurt.
2157- A plague o' both your houses! I am sped.
2158- Is he gone, and hath nothing?
2159- BENVOLIO
2160- What, art thou hurt?
2161- MERCUTIO
2162- Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch; marry, 'tis enough.
2163- Where is my page? Go, villain, fetch a surgeon.
2164- Exit Page
2165- 
2166- ROMEO
2167- Courage, man; the hurt cannot be much.
2168- MERCUTIO
2169- No, 'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a
2170- church-door; but 'tis enough,'twill serve: ask for
2171- me to-morrow, and you shall find me a grave man. I
2172- am peppered, I warrant, for this world. A plague o'
2173- both your houses! 'Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a
2174- cat, to scratch a man to death! a braggart, a
2175- rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of
2176- arithmetic! Why the devil came you between us? I
2177- was hurt under your arm.
2178- ROMEO
2179- I thought all for the best.
2180- MERCUTIO
2181- Help me into some house, Benvolio,
2182- Or I shall faint. A plague o' both your houses!
2183- They have made worms' meat of me: I have it,
2184- And soundly too: your houses!
2185- Exeunt MERCUTIO and BENVOLIO
2186- 
2187- ROMEO
2188- This gentleman, the prince's near ally,
2189- My very friend, hath got his mortal hurt
2190- In my behalf; my reputation stain'd
2191- With Tybalt's slander,--Tybalt, that an hour
2192- Hath been my kinsman! O sweet Juliet,
2193- Thy beauty hath made me effeminate
2194- And in my temper soften'd valour's steel!
2195- Re-enter BENVOLIO
2196- 
2197- BENVOLIO
2198- O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio's dead!
2199- That gallant spirit hath aspired the clouds,
2200- Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.
2201- ROMEO
2202- This day's black fate on more days doth depend;
2203- This but begins the woe, others must end.
2204- BENVOLIO
2205- Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.
2206- ROMEO
2207- Alive, in triumph! and Mercutio slain!
2208- Away to heaven, respective lenity,
2209- And fire-eyed fury be my conduct now!
2210- Re-enter TYBALT
2211- 
2212- Now, Tybalt, take the villain back again,
2213- That late thou gavest me; for Mercutio's soul
2214- Is but a little way above our heads,
2215- Staying for thine to keep him company:
2216- Either thou, or I, or both, must go with him.
2217- TYBALT
2218- Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here,
2219- Shalt with him hence.
2220- ROMEO
2221- This shall determine that.
2222- They fight; TYBALT falls
2223- 
2224- BENVOLIO
2225- Romeo, away, be gone!
2226- The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.
2227- Stand not amazed: the prince will doom thee death,
2228- If thou art taken: hence, be gone, away!
2229- ROMEO
2230- O, I am fortune's fool!
2231- BENVOLIO
2232- Why dost thou stay?
2233- Exit ROMEO
2234- 
2235- Enter Citizens, & c
2236- 
2237- First Citizen
2238- Which way ran he that kill'd Mercutio?
2239- Tybalt, that murderer, which way ran he?
2240- BENVOLIO
2241- There lies that Tybalt.
2242- First Citizen
2243- Up, sir, go with me;
2244- I charge thee in the princes name, obey.
2245- Enter Prince, attended; MONTAGUE, CAPULET, their Wives, and others
2246- 
2247- PRINCE
2248- Where are the vile beginners of this fray?
2249- BENVOLIO
2250- O noble prince, I can discover all
2251- The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl:
2252- There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,
2253- That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.
2254- LADY CAPULET
2255- Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother's child!
2256- O prince! O cousin! husband! O, the blood is spilt
2257- O my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,
2258- For blood of ours, shed blood of Montague.
2259- O cousin, cousin!
2260- PRINCE
2261- Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?
2262- BENVOLIO
2263- Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did slay;
2264- Romeo that spoke him fair, bade him bethink
2265- How nice the quarrel was, and urged withal
2266- Your high displeasure: all this uttered
2267- With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd,
2268- Could not take truce with the unruly spleen
2269- Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts
2270- With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast,
2271- Who all as hot, turns deadly point to point,
2272- And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats
2273- Cold death aside, and with the other sends
2274- It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity,
2275- Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud,
2276- 'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and, swifter than
2277- his tongue,
2278- His agile arm beats down their fatal points,
2279- And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm
2280- An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life
2281- Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;
2282- But by and by comes back to Romeo,
2283- Who had but newly entertain'd revenge,
2284- And to 't they go like lightning, for, ere I
2285- Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain.
2286- And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.
2287- This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.
2288- LADY CAPULET
2289- He is a kinsman to the Montague;
2290- Affection makes him false; he speaks not true:
2291- Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,
2292- And all those twenty could but kill one life.
2293- I beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give;
2294- Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live.
2295- PRINCE
2296- Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio;
2297- Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?
2298- MONTAGUE
2299- Not Romeo, prince, he was Mercutio's friend;
2300- His fault concludes but what the law should end,
2301- The life of Tybalt.
2302- PRINCE
2303- And for that offence
2304- Immediately we do exile him hence:
2305- I have an interest in your hate's proceeding,
2306- My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;
2307- But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine
2308- That you shall all repent the loss of mine:
2309- I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;
2310- Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses:
2311- Therefore use none: let Romeo hence in haste,
2312- Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
2313- Bear hence this body and attend our will:
2314- Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.
2315- Exeunt
2316- 
2317- SCENE II. Capulet's orchard.
2318- 
2319- Enter JULIET
2320- JULIET
2321- Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,
2322- Towards Phoebus' lodging: such a wagoner
2323- As Phaethon would whip you to the west,
2324- And bring in cloudy night immediately.
2325- Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,
2326- That runaway's eyes may wink and Romeo
2327- Leap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen.
2328- Lovers can see to do their amorous rites
2329- By their own beauties; or, if love be blind,
2330- It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,
2331- Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,
2332- And learn me how to lose a winning match,
2333- Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods:
2334- Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks,
2335- With thy black mantle; till strange love, grown bold,
2336- Think true love acted simple modesty.
2337- Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night;
2338- For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
2339- Whiter than new snow on a raven's back.
2340- Come, gentle night, come, loving, black-brow'd night,
2341- Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,
2342- Take him and cut him out in little stars,
2343- And he will make the face of heaven so fine
2344- That all the world will be in love with night
2345- And pay no worship to the garish sun.
2346- O, I have bought the mansion of a love,
2347- But not possess'd it, and, though I am sold,
2348- Not yet enjoy'd: so tedious is this day
2349- As is the night before some festival
2350- To an impatient child that hath new robes
2351- And may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse,
2352- And she brings news; and every tongue that speaks
2353- But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.
2354- Enter Nurse, with cords
2355- 
2356- Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords
2357- That Romeo bid thee fetch?
2358- Nurse
2359- Ay, ay, the cords.
2360- Throws them down
2361- 
2362- JULIET
2363- Ay me! what news? why dost thou wring thy hands?
2364- Nurse
2365- Ah, well-a-day! he's dead, he's dead, he's dead!
2366- We are undone, lady, we are undone!
2367- Alack the day! he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead!
2368- JULIET
2369- Can heaven be so envious?
2370- Nurse
2371- Romeo can,
2372- Though heaven cannot: O Romeo, Romeo!
2373- Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!
2374- JULIET
2375- What devil art thou, that dost torment me thus?
2376- This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.
2377- Hath Romeo slain himself? say thou but 'I,'
2378- And that bare vowel 'I' shall poison more
2379- Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice:
2380- I am not I, if there be such an I;
2381- Or those eyes shut, that make thee answer 'I.'
2382- If he be slain, say 'I'; or if not, no:
2383- Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.
2384- Nurse
2385- I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,--
2386- God save the mark!--here on his manly breast:
2387- A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;
2388- Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood,
2389- All in gore-blood; I swounded at the sight.
2390- JULIET
2391- O, break, my heart! poor bankrupt, break at once!
2392- To prison, eyes, ne'er look on liberty!
2393- Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;
2394- And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!
2395- Nurse
2396- O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!
2397- O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman!
2398- That ever I should live to see thee dead!
2399- JULIET
2400- What storm is this that blows so contrary?
2401- Is Romeo slaughter'd, and is Tybalt dead?
2402- My dear-loved cousin, and my dearer lord?
2403- Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!
2404- For who is living, if those two are gone?
2405- Nurse
2406- Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished;
2407- Romeo that kill'd him, he is banished.
2408- JULIET
2409- O God! did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?
2410- Nurse
2411- It did, it did; alas the day, it did!
2412- JULIET
2413- O serpent heart, hid with a flowering face!
2414- Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?
2415- Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!
2416- Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb!
2417- Despised substance of divinest show!
2418- Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st,
2419- A damned saint, an honourable villain!
2420- O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell,
2421- When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
2422- In moral paradise of such sweet flesh?
2423- Was ever book containing such vile matter
2424- So fairly bound? O that deceit should dwell
2425- In such a gorgeous palace!
2426- Nurse
2427- There's no trust,
2428- No faith, no honesty in men; all perjured,
2429- All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.
2430- Ah, where's my man? give me some aqua vitae:
2431- These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.
2432- Shame come to Romeo!
2433- JULIET
2434- Blister'd be thy tongue
2435- For such a wish! he was not born to shame:
2436- Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit;
2437- For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd
2438- Sole monarch of the universal earth.
2439- O, what a beast was I to chide at him!
2440- Nurse
2441- Will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin?
2442- JULIET
2443- Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?
2444- Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name,
2445- When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?
2446- But, wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?
2447- That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband:
2448- Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring;
2449- Your tributary drops belong to woe,
2450- Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.
2451- My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;
2452- And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband:
2453- All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?
2454- Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,
2455- That murder'd me: I would forget it fain;
2456- But, O, it presses to my memory,
2457- Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds:
2458- 'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo--banished;'
2459- That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,'
2460- Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death
2461- Was woe enough, if it had ended there:
2462- Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship
2463- And needly will be rank'd with other griefs,
2464- Why follow'd not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,'
2465- Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,
2466- Which modern lamentations might have moved?
2467- But with a rear-ward following Tybalt's death,
2468- 'Romeo is banished,' to speak that word,
2469- Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,
2470- All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished!'
2471- There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,
2472- In that word's death; no words can that woe sound.
2473- Where is my father, and my mother, nurse?
2474- Nurse
2475- Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse:
2476- Will you go to them? I will bring you thither.
2477- JULIET
2478- Wash they his wounds with tears: mine shall be spent,
2479- When theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment.
2480- Take up those cords: poor ropes, you are beguiled,
2481- Both you and I; for Romeo is exiled:
2482- He made you for a highway to my bed;
2483- But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.
2484- Come, cords, come, nurse; I'll to my wedding-bed;
2485- And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!
2486- Nurse
2487- Hie to your chamber: I'll find Romeo
2488- To comfort you: I wot well where he is.
2489- Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night:
2490- I'll to him; he is hid at Laurence' cell.
2491- JULIET
2492- O, find him! give this ring to my true knight,
2493- And bid him come to take his last farewell.
2494- Exeunt
2495- 
2496- SCENE III. Friar Laurence's cell.
2497- 
2498- Enter FRIAR LAURENCE
2499- FRIAR LAURENCE
2500- Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man:
2501- Affliction is enamour'd of thy parts,
2502- And thou art wedded to calamity.
2503- Enter ROMEO
2504- 
2505- ROMEO
2506- Father, what news? what is the prince's doom?
2507- What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand,
2508- That I yet know not?
2509- FRIAR LAURENCE
2510- Too familiar
2511- Is my dear son with such sour company:
2512- I bring thee tidings of the prince's doom.
2513- ROMEO
2514- What less than dooms-day is the prince's doom?
2515- FRIAR LAURENCE
2516- A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips,
2517- Not body's death, but body's banishment.
2518- ROMEO
2519- Ha, banishment! be merciful, say 'death;'
2520- For exile hath more terror in his look,
2521- Much more than death: do not say 'banishment.'
2522- FRIAR LAURENCE
2523- Hence from Verona art thou banished:
2524- Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.
2525- ROMEO
2526- There is no world without Verona walls,
2527- But purgatory, torture, hell itself.
2528- Hence-banished is banish'd from the world,
2529- And world's exile is death: then banished,
2530- Is death mis-term'd: calling death banishment,
2531- Thou cutt'st my head off with a golden axe,
2532- And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.
2533- FRIAR LAURENCE
2534- O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!
2535- Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind prince,
2536- Taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law,
2537- And turn'd that black word death to banishment:
2538- This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.
2539- ROMEO
2540- 'Tis torture, and not mercy: heaven is here,
2541- Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog
2542- And little mouse, every unworthy thing,
2543- Live here in heaven and may look on her;
2544- But Romeo may not: more validity,
2545- More honourable state, more courtship lives
2546- In carrion-flies than Romeo: they my seize
2547- On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand
2548- And steal immortal blessing from her lips,
2549- Who even in pure and vestal modesty,
2550- Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;
2551- But Romeo may not; he is banished:
2552- Flies may do this, but I from this must fly:
2553- They are free men, but I am banished.
2554- And say'st thou yet that exile is not death?
2555- Hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife,
2556- No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,
2557- But 'banished' to kill me?--'banished'?
2558- O friar, the damned use that word in hell;
2559- Howlings attend it: how hast thou the heart,
2560- Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,
2561- A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,
2562- To mangle me with that word 'banished'?
2563- FRIAR LAURENCE
2564- Thou fond mad man, hear me but speak a word.
2565- ROMEO
2566- O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.
2567- FRIAR LAURENCE
2568- I'll give thee armour to keep off that word:
2569- Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy,
2570- To comfort thee, though thou art banished.
2571- ROMEO
2572- Yet 'banished'? Hang up philosophy!
2573- Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,
2574- Displant a town, reverse a prince's doom,
2575- It helps not, it prevails not: talk no more.
2576- FRIAR LAURENCE
2577- O, then I see that madmen have no ears.
2578- ROMEO
2579- How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?
2580- FRIAR LAURENCE
2581- Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.
2582- ROMEO
2583- Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel:
2584- Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,
2585- An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,
2586- Doting like me and like me banished,
2587- Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,
2588- And fall upon the ground, as I do now,
2589- Taking the measure of an unmade grave.
2590- Knocking within
2591- 
2592- FRIAR LAURENCE
2593- Arise; one knocks; good Romeo, hide thyself.
2594- ROMEO
2595- Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans,
2596- Mist-like, infold me from the search of eyes.
2597- Knocking
2598- 
2599- FRIAR LAURENCE
2600- Hark, how they knock! Who's there? Romeo, arise;
2601- Thou wilt be taken. Stay awhile! Stand up;
2602- Knocking
2603- 
2604- Run to my study. By and by! God's will,
2605- What simpleness is this! I come, I come!
2606- Knocking
2607- 
2608- Who knocks so hard? whence come you? what's your will?
2609- Nurse
2610- [Within] Let me come in, and you shall know
2611- my errand;
2612- I come from Lady Juliet.
2613- FRIAR LAURENCE
2614- Welcome, then.
2615- Enter Nurse
2616- 
2617- Nurse
2618- O holy friar, O, tell me, holy friar,
2619- Where is my lady's lord, where's Romeo?
2620- FRIAR LAURENCE
2621- There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk.
2622- Nurse
2623- O, he is even in my mistress' case,
2624- Just in her case! O woful sympathy!
2625- Piteous predicament! Even so lies she,
2626- Blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering.
2627- Stand up, stand up; stand, and you be a man:
2628- For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand;
2629- Why should you fall into so deep an O?
2630- ROMEO
2631- Nurse!
2632- Nurse
2633- Ah sir! ah sir! Well, death's the end of all.
2634- ROMEO
2635- Spakest thou of Juliet? how is it with her?
2636- Doth she not think me an old murderer,
2637- Now I have stain'd the childhood of our joy
2638- With blood removed but little from her own?
2639- Where is she? and how doth she? and what says
2640- My conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?
2641- Nurse
2642- O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;
2643- And now falls on her bed; and then starts up,
2644- And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries,
2645- And then down falls again.
2646- ROMEO
2647- As if that name,
2648- Shot from the deadly level of a gun,
2649- Did murder her; as that name's cursed hand
2650- Murder'd her kinsman. O, tell me, friar, tell me,
2651- In what vile part of this anatomy
2652- Doth my name lodge? tell me, that I may sack
2653- The hateful mansion.
2654- Drawing his sword
2655- 
2656- FRIAR LAURENCE
2657- Hold thy desperate hand:
2658- Art thou a man? thy form cries out thou art:
2659- Thy tears are womanish; thy wild acts denote
2660- The unreasonable fury of a beast:
2661- Unseemly woman in a seeming man!
2662- Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!
2663- Thou hast amazed me: by my holy order,
2664- I thought thy disposition better temper'd.
2665- Hast thou slain Tybalt? wilt thou slay thyself?
2666- And stay thy lady too that lives in thee,
2667- By doing damned hate upon thyself?
2668- Why rail'st thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?
2669- Since birth, and heaven, and earth, all three do meet
2670- In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.
2671- Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit;
2672- Which, like a usurer, abound'st in all,
2673- And usest none in that true use indeed
2674- Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit:
2675- Thy noble shape is but a form of wax,
2676- Digressing from the valour of a man;
2677- Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,
2678- Killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish;
2679- Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,
2680- Misshapen in the conduct of them both,
2681- Like powder in a skitless soldier's flask,
2682- Is set afire by thine own ignorance,
2683- And thou dismember'd with thine own defence.
2684- What, rouse thee, man! thy Juliet is alive,
2685- For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead;
2686- There art thou happy: Tybalt would kill thee,
2687- But thou slew'st Tybalt; there are thou happy too:
2688- The law that threaten'd death becomes thy friend
2689- And turns it to exile; there art thou happy:
2690- A pack of blessings lights up upon thy back;
2691- Happiness courts thee in her best array;
2692- But, like a misbehaved and sullen wench,
2693- Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love:
2694- Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.
2695- Go, get thee to thy love, as was decreed,
2696- Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her:
2697- But look thou stay not till the watch be set,
2698- For then thou canst not pass to Mantua;
2699- Where thou shalt live, till we can find a time
2700- To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,
2701- Beg pardon of the prince, and call thee back
2702- With twenty hundred thousand times more joy
2703- Than thou went'st forth in lamentation.
2704- Go before, nurse: commend me to thy lady;
2705- And bid her hasten all the house to bed,
2706- Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto:
2707- Romeo is coming.
2708- Nurse
2709- O Lord, I could have stay'd here all the night
2710- To hear good counsel: O, what learning is!
2711- My lord, I'll tell my lady you will come.
2712- ROMEO
2713- Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.
2714- Nurse
2715- Here, sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir:
2716- Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.
2717- Exit
2718- 
2719- ROMEO
2720- How well my comfort is revived by this!
2721- FRIAR LAURENCE
2722- Go hence; good night; and here stands all your state:
2723- Either be gone before the watch be set,
2724- Or by the break of day disguised from hence:
2725- Sojourn in Mantua; I'll find out your man,
2726- And he shall signify from time to time
2727- Every good hap to you that chances here:
2728- Give me thy hand; 'tis late: farewell; good night.
2729- ROMEO
2730- But that a joy past joy calls out on me,
2731- It were a grief, so brief to part with thee: Farewell.
2732- Exeunt
2733- 
2734- SCENE IV. A room in Capulet's house.
2735- 
2736- Enter CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, and PARIS
2737- CAPULET
2738- Things have fall'n out, sir, so unluckily,
2739- That we have had no time to move our daughter:
2740- Look you, she loved her kinsman Tybalt dearly,
2741- And so did I:--Well, we were born to die.
2742- 'Tis very late, she'll not come down to-night:
2743- I promise you, but for your company,
2744- I would have been a-bed an hour ago.
2745- PARIS
2746- These times of woe afford no time to woo.
2747- Madam, good night: commend me to your daughter.
2748- LADY CAPULET
2749- I will, and know her mind early to-morrow;
2750- To-night she is mew'd up to her heaviness.
2751- CAPULET
2752- Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender
2753- Of my child's love: I think she will be ruled
2754- In all respects by me; nay, more, I doubt it not.
2755- Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed;
2756- Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love;
2757- And bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next--
2758- But, soft! what day is this?
2759- PARIS
2760- Monday, my lord,
2761- CAPULET
2762- Monday! ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon,
2763- O' Thursday let it be: o' Thursday, tell her,
2764- She shall be married to this noble earl.
2765- Will you be ready? do you like this haste?
2766- We'll keep no great ado,--a friend or two;
2767- For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,
2768- It may be thought we held him carelessly,
2769- Being our kinsman, if we revel much:
2770- Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends,
2771- And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?
2772- PARIS
2773- My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow.
2774- CAPULET
2775- Well get you gone: o' Thursday be it, then.
2776- Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed,
2777- Prepare her, wife, against this wedding-day.
2778- Farewell, my lord. Light to my chamber, ho!
2779- Afore me! it is so very very late,
2780- That we may call it early by and by.
2781- Good night.
2782- Exeunt
2783- 
2784- SCENE V. Capulet's orchard.
2785- 
2786- Enter ROMEO and JULIET above, at the window
2787- JULIET
2788- Wilt thou be gone? it is not yet near day:
2789- It was the nightingale, and not the lark,
2790- That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear;
2791- Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate-tree:
2792- Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.
2793- ROMEO
2794- It was the lark, the herald of the morn,
2795- No nightingale: look, love, what envious streaks
2796- Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east:
2797- Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day
2798- Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.
2799- I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
2800- JULIET
2801- Yon light is not day-light, I know it, I:
2802- It is some meteor that the sun exhales,
2803- To be to thee this night a torch-bearer,
2804- And light thee on thy way to Mantua:
2805- Therefore stay yet; thou need'st not to be gone.
2806- ROMEO
2807- Let me be ta'en, let me be put to death;
2808- I am content, so thou wilt have it so.
2809- I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye,
2810- 'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow;
2811- Nor that is not the lark, whose notes do beat
2812- The vaulty heaven so high above our heads:
2813- I have more care to stay than will to go:
2814- Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so.
2815- How is't, my soul? let's talk; it is not day.
2816- JULIET
2817- It is, it is: hie hence, be gone, away!
2818- It is the lark that sings so out of tune,
2819- Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.
2820- Some say the lark makes sweet division;
2821- This doth not so, for she divideth us:
2822- Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes,
2823- O, now I would they had changed voices too!
2824- Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,
2825- Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day,
2826- O, now be gone; more light and light it grows.
2827- ROMEO
2828- More light and light; more dark and dark our woes!
2829- Enter Nurse, to the chamber
2830- 
2831- Nurse
2832- Madam!
2833- JULIET
2834- Nurse?
2835- Nurse
2836- Your lady mother is coming to your chamber:
2837- The day is broke; be wary, look about.
2838- Exit
2839- 
2840- JULIET
2841- Then, window, let day in, and let life out.
2842- ROMEO
2843- Farewell, farewell! one kiss, and I'll descend.
2844- He goeth down
2845- 
2846- JULIET
2847- Art thou gone so? love, lord, ay, husband, friend!
2848- I must hear from thee every day in the hour,
2849- For in a minute there are many days:
2850- O, by this count I shall be much in years
2851- Ere I again behold my Romeo!
2852- ROMEO
2853- Farewell!
2854- I will omit no opportunity
2855- That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.
2856- JULIET
2857- O think'st thou we shall ever meet again?
2858- ROMEO
2859- I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve
2860- For sweet discourses in our time to come.
2861- JULIET
2862- O God, I have an ill-divining soul!
2863- Methinks I see thee, now thou art below,
2864- As one dead in the bottom of a tomb:
2865- Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.
2866- ROMEO
2867- And trust me, love, in my eye so do you:
2868- Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu!
2869- Exit
2870- 
2871- JULIET
2872- O fortune, fortune! all men call thee fickle:
2873- If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him.
2874- That is renown'd for faith? Be fickle, fortune;
2875- For then, I hope, thou wilt not keep him long,
2876- But send him back.
2877- LADY CAPULET
2878- [Within] Ho, daughter! are you up?
2879- JULIET
2880- Who is't that calls? is it my lady mother?
2881- Is she not down so late, or up so early?
2882- What unaccustom'd cause procures her hither?
2883- Enter LADY CAPULET
2884- 
2885- LADY CAPULET
2886- Why, how now, Juliet!
2887- JULIET
2888- Madam, I am not well.
2889- LADY CAPULET
2890- Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
2891- What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?
2892- An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live;
2893- Therefore, have done: some grief shows much of love;
2894- But much of grief shows still some want of wit.
2895- JULIET
2896- Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.
2897- LADY CAPULET
2898- So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend
2899- Which you weep for.
2900- JULIET
2901- Feeling so the loss,
2902- Cannot choose but ever weep the friend.
2903- LADY CAPULET
2904- Well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death,
2905- As that the villain lives which slaughter'd him.
2906- JULIET
2907- What villain madam?
2908- LADY CAPULET
2909- That same villain, Romeo.
2910- JULIET
2911- [Aside] Villain and he be many miles asunder.--
2912- God Pardon him! I do, with all my heart;
2913- And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.
2914- LADY CAPULET
2915- That is, because the traitor murderer lives.
2916- JULIET
2917- Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands:
2918- Would none but I might venge my cousin's death!
2919- LADY CAPULET
2920- We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not:
2921- Then weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua,
2922- Where that same banish'd runagate doth live,
2923- Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram,
2924- That he shall soon keep Tybalt company:
2925- And then, I hope, thou wilt be satisfied.
2926- JULIET
2927- Indeed, I never shall be satisfied
2928- With Romeo, till I behold him--dead--
2929- Is my poor heart for a kinsman vex'd.
2930- Madam, if you could find out but a man
2931- To bear a poison, I would temper it;
2932- That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,
2933- Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors
2934- To hear him named, and cannot come to him.
2935- To wreak the love I bore my cousin
2936- Upon his body that slaughter'd him!
2937- LADY CAPULET
2938- Find thou the means, and I'll find such a man.
2939- But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.
2940- JULIET
2941- And joy comes well in such a needy time:
2942- What are they, I beseech your ladyship?
2943- LADY CAPULET
2944- Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;
2945- One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,
2946- Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy,
2947- That thou expect'st not nor I look'd not for.
2948- JULIET
2949- Madam, in happy time, what day is that?
2950- LADY CAPULET
2951- Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn,
2952- The gallant, young and noble gentleman,
2953- The County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church,
2954- Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.
2955- JULIET
2956- Now, by Saint Peter's Church and Peter too,
2957- He shall not make me there a joyful bride.
2958- I wonder at this haste; that I must wed
2959- Ere he, that should be husband, comes to woo.
2960- I pray you, tell my lord and father, madam,
2961- I will not marry yet; and, when I do, I swear,
2962- It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,
2963- Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!
2964- LADY CAPULET
2965- Here comes your father; tell him so yourself,
2966- And see how he will take it at your hands.
2967- Enter CAPULET and Nurse
2968- 
2969- CAPULET
2970- When the sun sets, the air doth drizzle dew;
2971- But for the sunset of my brother's son
2972- It rains downright.
2973- How now! a conduit, girl? what, still in tears?
2974- Evermore showering? In one little body
2975- Thou counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind;
2976- For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,
2977- Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is,
2978- Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs;
2979- Who, raging with thy tears, and they with them,
2980- Without a sudden calm, will overset
2981- Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife!
2982- Have you deliver'd to her our decree?
2983- LADY CAPULET
2984- Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.
2985- I would the fool were married to her grave!
2986- CAPULET
2987- Soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife.
2988- How! will she none? doth she not give us thanks?
2989- Is she not proud? doth she not count her blest,
2990- Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought
2991- So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?
2992- JULIET
2993- Not proud, you have; but thankful, that you have:
2994- Proud can I never be of what I hate;
2995- But thankful even for hate, that is meant love.
2996- CAPULET
2997- How now, how now, chop-logic! What is this?
2998- 'Proud,' and 'I thank you,' and 'I thank you not;'
2999- And yet 'not proud,' mistress minion, you,
3000- Thank me no thankings, nor, proud me no prouds,
3001- But fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next,
3002- To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,
3003- Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.
3004- Out, you green-sickness carrion! out, you baggage!
3005- You tallow-face!
3006- LADY CAPULET
3007- Fie, fie! what, are you mad?
3008- JULIET
3009- Good father, I beseech you on my knees,
3010- Hear me with patience but to speak a word.
3011- CAPULET
3012- Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch!
3013- I tell thee what: get thee to church o' Thursday,
3014- Or never after look me in the face:
3015- Speak not, reply not, do not answer me;
3016- My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest
3017- That God had lent us but this only child;
3018- But now I see this one is one too much,
3019- And that we have a curse in having her:
3020- Out on her, hilding!
3021- Nurse
3022- God in heaven bless her!
3023- You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.
3024- CAPULET
3025- And why, my lady wisdom? hold your tongue,
3026- Good prudence; smatter with your gossips, go.
3027- Nurse
3028- I speak no treason.
3029- CAPULET
3030- O, God ye god-den.
3031- Nurse
3032- May not one speak?
3033- CAPULET
3034- Peace, you mumbling fool!
3035- Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl;
3036- For here we need it not.
3037- LADY CAPULET
3038- You are too hot.
3039- CAPULET
3040- God's bread! it makes me mad:
3041- Day, night, hour, tide, time, work, play,
3042- Alone, in company, still my care hath been
3043- To have her match'd: and having now provided
3044- A gentleman of noble parentage,
3045- Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd,
3046- Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,
3047- Proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man;
3048- And then to have a wretched puling fool,
3049- A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,
3050- To answer 'I'll not wed; I cannot love,
3051- I am too young; I pray you, pardon me.'
3052- But, as you will not wed, I'll pardon you:
3053- Graze where you will you shall not house with me:
3054- Look to't, think on't, I do not use to jest.
3055- Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise:
3056- An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend;
3057- And you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in
3058- the streets,
3059- For, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,
3060- Nor what is mine shall never do thee good:
3061- Trust to't, bethink you; I'll not be forsworn.
3062- Exit
3063- 
3064- JULIET
3065- Is there no pity sitting in the clouds,
3066- That sees into the bottom of my grief?
3067- O, sweet my mother, cast me not away!
3068- Delay this marriage for a month, a week;
3069- Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed
3070- In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.
3071- LADY CAPULET
3072- Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word:
3073- Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.
3074- Exit
3075- 
3076- JULIET
3077- O God!--O nurse, how shall this be prevented?
3078- My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven;
3079- How shall that faith return again to earth,
3080- Unless that husband send it me from heaven
3081- By leaving earth? comfort me, counsel me.
3082- Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems
3083- Upon so soft a subject as myself!
3084- What say'st thou? hast thou not a word of joy?
3085- Some comfort, nurse.
3086- Nurse
3087- Faith, here it is.
3088- Romeo is banish'd; and all the world to nothing,
3089- That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you;
3090- Or, if he do, it needs must be by stealth.
3091- Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,
3092- I think it best you married with the county.
3093- O, he's a lovely gentleman!
3094- Romeo's a dishclout to him: an eagle, madam,
3095- Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye
3096- As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,
3097- I think you are happy in this second match,
3098- For it excels your first: or if it did not,
3099- Your first is dead; or 'twere as good he were,
3100- As living here and you no use of him.
3101- JULIET
3102- Speakest thou from thy heart?
3103- Nurse
3104- And from my soul too;
3105- Or else beshrew them both.
3106- JULIET
3107- Amen!
3108- Nurse
3109- What?
3110- JULIET
3111- Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.
3112- Go in: and tell my lady I am gone,
3113- Having displeased my father, to Laurence' cell,
3114- To make confession and to be absolved.
3115- Nurse
3116- Marry, I will; and this is wisely done.
3117- Exit
3118- 
3119- JULIET
3120- Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend!
3121- Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,
3122- Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue
3123- Which she hath praised him with above compare
3124- So many thousand times? Go, counsellor;
3125- Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.
3126- I'll to the friar, to know his remedy:
3127- If all else fail, myself have power to die.
3128- Exit

3132- SCENE I. Friar Laurence's cell.
3133- 
3134- Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and PARIS
3135- FRIAR LAURENCE
3136- On Thursday, sir? the time is very short.
3137- PARIS
3138- My father Capulet will have it so;
3139- And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.
3140- FRIAR LAURENCE
3141- You say you do not know the lady's mind:
3142- Uneven is the course, I like it not.
3143- PARIS
3144- Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,
3145- And therefore have I little talk'd of love;
3146- For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.
3147- Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous
3148- That she doth give her sorrow so much sway,
3149- And in his wisdom hastes our marriage,
3150- To stop the inundation of her tears;
3151- Which, too much minded by herself alone,
3152- May be put from her by society:
3153- Now do you know the reason of this haste.
3154- FRIAR LAURENCE
3155- [Aside] I would I knew not why it should be slow'd.
3156- Look, sir, here comes the lady towards my cell.
3157- Enter JULIET
3158- 
3159- PARIS
3160- Happily met, my lady and my wife!
3161- JULIET
3162- That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.
3163- PARIS
3164- That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.
3165- JULIET
3166- What must be shall be.
3167- FRIAR LAURENCE
3168- That's a certain text.
3169- PARIS
3170- Come you to make confession to this father?
3171- JULIET
3172- To answer that, I should confess to you.
3173- PARIS
3174- Do not deny to him that you love me.
3175- JULIET
3176- I will confess to you that I love him.
3177- PARIS
3178- So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.
3179- JULIET
3180- If I do so, it will be of more price,
3181- Being spoke behind your back, than to your face.
3182- PARIS
3183- Poor soul, thy face is much abused with tears.
3184- JULIET
3185- The tears have got small victory by that;
3186- For it was bad enough before their spite.
3187- PARIS
3188- Thou wrong'st it, more than tears, with that report.
3189- JULIET
3190- That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;
3191- And what I spake, I spake it to my face.
3192- PARIS
3193- Thy face is mine, and thou hast slander'd it.
3194- JULIET
3195- It may be so, for it is not mine own.
3196- Are you at leisure, holy father, now;
3197- Or shall I come to you at evening mass?
3198- FRIAR LAURENCE
3199- My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.
3200- My lord, we must entreat the time alone.
3201- PARIS
3202- God shield I should disturb devotion!
3203- Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye:
3204- Till then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss.
3205- Exit
3206- 
3207- JULIET
3208- O shut the door! and when thou hast done so,
3209- Come weep with me; past hope, past cure, past help!
3210- FRIAR LAURENCE
3211- Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief;
3212- It strains me past the compass of my wits:
3213- I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,
3214- On Thursday next be married to this county.
3215- JULIET
3216- Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,
3217- Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it:
3218- If, in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help,
3219- Do thou but call my resolution wise,
3220- And with this knife I'll help it presently.
3221- God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;
3222- And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo seal'd,
3223- Shall be the label to another deed,
3224- Or my true heart with treacherous revolt
3225- Turn to another, this shall slay them both:
3226- Therefore, out of thy long-experienced time,
3227- Give me some present counsel, or, behold,
3228- 'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
3229- Shall play the umpire, arbitrating that
3230- Which the commission of thy years and art
3231- Could to no issue of true honour bring.
3232- Be not so long to speak; I long to die,
3233- If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.
3234- FRIAR LAURENCE
3235- Hold, daughter: I do spy a kind of hope,
3236- Which craves as desperate an execution.
3237- As that is desperate which we would prevent.
3238- If, rather than to marry County Paris,
3239- Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,
3240- Then is it likely thou wilt undertake
3241- A thing like death to chide away this shame,
3242- That copest with death himself to scape from it:
3243- And, if thou darest, I'll give thee remedy.
3244- JULIET
3245- O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,
3246- From off the battlements of yonder tower;
3247- Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk
3248- Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears;
3249- Or shut me nightly in a charnel-house,
3250- O'er-cover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,
3251- With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;
3252- Or bid me go into a new-made grave
3253- And hide me with a dead man in his shroud;
3254- Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble;
3255- And I will do it without fear or doubt,
3256- To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.
3257- FRIAR LAURENCE
3258- Hold, then; go home, be merry, give consent
3259- To marry Paris: Wednesday is to-morrow:
3260- To-morrow night look that thou lie alone;
3261- Let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber:
3262- Take thou this vial, being then in bed,
3263- And this distilled liquor drink thou off;
3264- When presently through all thy veins shall run
3265- A cold and drowsy humour, for no pulse
3266- Shall keep his native progress, but surcease:
3267- No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;
3268- The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
3269- To paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall,
3270- Like death, when he shuts up the day of life;
3271- Each part, deprived of supple government,
3272- Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death:
3273- And in this borrow'd likeness of shrunk death
3274- Thou shalt continue two and forty hours,
3275- And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.
3276- Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes
3277- To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead:
3278- Then, as the manner of our country is,
3279- In thy best robes uncover'd on the bier
3280- Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault
3281- Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.
3282- In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,
3283- Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift,
3284- And hither shall he come: and he and I
3285- Will watch thy waking, and that very night
3286- Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.
3287- And this shall free thee from this present shame;
3288- If no inconstant toy, nor womanish fear,
3289- Abate thy valour in the acting it.
3290- JULIET
3291- Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!
3292- FRIAR LAURENCE
3293- Hold; get you gone, be strong and prosperous
3294- In this resolve: I'll send a friar with speed
3295- To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.
3296- JULIET
3297- Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.
3298- Farewell, dear father!
3299- Exeunt

3305- So many guests invite as here are writ.
3306- Exit First Servant
3307- 
3308- Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks.
3309- Second Servant
3310- You shall have none ill, sir; for I'll try if they
3311- can lick their fingers.
3312- CAPULET
3313- How canst thou try them so?
3314- Second Servant
3315- Marry, sir, 'tis an ill cook that cannot lick his
3316- own fingers: therefore he that cannot lick his
3317- fingers goes not with me.
3318- CAPULET
3319- Go, be gone.
3320- Exit Second Servant
3321- 
3322- We shall be much unfurnished for this time.
3323- What, is my daughter gone to Friar Laurence?
3324- Nurse
3325- Ay, forsooth.
3326- CAPULET
3327- Well, he may chance to do some good on her:
3328- A peevish self-will'd harlotry it is.
3329- Nurse
3330- See where she comes from shrift with merry look.
3331- Enter JULIET
3332- 
3333- CAPULET
3334- How now, my headstrong! where have you been gadding?
3335- JULIET
3336- Where I have learn'd me to repent the sin
3337- Of disobedient opposition
3338- To you and your behests, and am enjoin'd
3339- By holy Laurence to fall prostrate here,
3340- And beg your pardon: pardon, I beseech you!
3341- Henceforward I am ever ruled by you.
3342- CAPULET
3343- Send for the county; go tell him of this:
3344- I'll have this knot knit up to-morrow morning.
3345- JULIET
3346- I met the youthful lord at Laurence' cell;
3347- And gave him what becomed love I might,
3348- Not step o'er the bounds of modesty.
3349- CAPULET
3350- Why, I am glad on't; this is well: stand up:
3351- This is as't should be. Let me see the county;
3352- Ay, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither.
3353- Now, afore God! this reverend holy friar,
3354- Our whole city is much bound to him.
3355- JULIET
3356- Nurse, will you go with me into my closet,
3357- To help me sort such needful ornaments
3358- As you think fit to furnish me to-morrow?
3359- LADY CAPULET
3360- No, not till Thursday; there is time enough.
3361- CAPULET
3362- Go, nurse, go with her: we'll to church to-morrow.
3363- Exeunt JULIET and Nurse
3364- 
3365- LADY CAPULET
3366- We shall be short in our provision:
3367- 'Tis now near night.
3368- CAPULET
3369- Tush, I will stir about,
3370- And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife:
3371- Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her;
3372- I'll not to bed to-night; let me alone;
3373- I'll play the housewife for this once. What, ho!
3374- They are all forth. Well, I will walk myself
3375- To County Paris, to prepare him up
3376- Against to-morrow: my heart is wondrous light,
3377- Since this same wayward girl is so reclaim'd.
3378- Exeunt
3379- 
3380- SCENE III. Juliet's chamber.
3381- 
3382- Enter JULIET and Nurse
3383- JULIET
3384- Ay, those attires are best: but, gentle nurse,
3385- I pray thee, leave me to my self to-night,
3386- For I have need of many orisons
3387- To move the heavens to smile upon my state,
3388- Which, well thou know'st, is cross, and full of sin.
3389- Enter LADY CAPULET
3390- 
3391- LADY CAPULET
3392- What, are you busy, ho? need you my help?
3393- JULIET
3394- No, madam; we have cull'd such necessaries
3395- As are behoveful for our state to-morrow:
3396- So please you, let me now be left alone,
3397- And let the nurse this night sit up with you;
3398- For, I am sure, you have your hands full all,
3399- In this so sudden business.
3400- LADY CAPULET
3401- Good night:
3402- Get thee to bed, and rest; for thou hast need.
3403- Exeunt LADY CAPULET and Nurse
3404- 
3405- JULIET
3406- Farewell! God knows when we shall meet again.
3407- I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins,
3408- That almost freezes up the heat of life:
3409- I'll call them back again to comfort me:
3410- Nurse! What should she do here?
3411- My dismal scene I needs must act alone.
3412- Come, vial.
3413- What if this mixture do not work at all?
3414- Shall I be married then to-morrow morning?
3415- No, no: this shall forbid it: lie thou there.
3416- Laying down her dagger
3417- 
3418- What if it be a poison, which the friar
3419- Subtly hath minister'd to have me dead,
3420- Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd,
3421- Because he married me before to Romeo?
3422- I fear it is: and yet, methinks, it should not,
3423- For he hath still been tried a holy man.
3424- How if, when I am laid into the tomb,
3425- I wake before the time that Romeo
3426- Come to redeem me? there's a fearful point!
3427- Shall I not, then, be stifled in the vault,
3428- To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,
3429- And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?
3430- Or, if I live, is it not very like,
3431- The horrible conceit of death and night,
3432- Together with the terror of the place,--
3433- As in a vault, an ancient receptacle,
3434- Where, for these many hundred years, the bones
3435- Of all my buried ancestors are packed:
3436- Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,
3437- Lies festering in his shroud; where, as they say,
3438- At some hours in the night spirits resort;--
3439- Alack, alack, is it not like that I,
3440- So early waking, what with loathsome smells,
3441- And shrieks like mandrakes' torn out of the earth,
3442- That living mortals, hearing them, run mad:--
3443- O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,
3444- Environed with all these hideous fears?
3445- And madly play with my forefather's joints?
3446- And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud?
3447- And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone,
3448- As with a club, dash out my desperate brains?
3449- O, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost
3450- Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body
3451- Upon a rapier's point: stay, Tybalt, stay!
3452- Romeo, I come! this do I drink to thee.

3463- 
3464- CAPULET
3465- Come, stir, stir, stir! the second cock hath crow'd,
3466- The curfew-bell hath rung, 'tis three o'clock:
3467- Look to the baked meats, good Angelica:
3468- Spare not for the cost.
3469- Nurse
3470- Go, you cot-quean, go,
3471- Get you to bed; faith, You'll be sick to-morrow
3472- For this night's watching.
3473- CAPULET
3474- No, not a whit: what! I have watch'd ere now
3475- All night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick.
3476- LADY CAPULET
3477- Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time;
3478- But I will watch you from such watching now.
3479- Exeunt LADY CAPULET and Nurse

3490- Make haste, make haste.
3491- Exit First Servant
3492- 
3493- Sirrah, fetch drier logs:
3494- Call Peter, he will show thee where they are.
3495- Second Servant

3497- And never trouble Peter for the matter.
3498- Exit
3499- 
3500- CAPULET
3501- Mass, and well said; a merry whoreson, ha!
3502- Thou shalt be logger-head. Good faith, 'tis day:
3503- The county will be here with music straight,
3504- For so he said he would: I hear him near.
3505- Music within
3506- 
3507- Nurse! Wife! What, ho! What, nurse, I say!
3508- Re-enter Nurse
3509- 
3510- Go waken Juliet, go and trim her up;

3523- What, not a word? you take your pennyworths now;
3524- Sleep for a week; for the next night, I warrant,
3525- The County Paris hath set up his rest,
3526- That you shall rest but little. God forgive me,
3527- Marry, and amen, how sound is she asleep!
3528- I must needs wake her. Madam, madam, madam!

3586- Have I thought long to see this morning's face,
3587- And doth it give me such a sight as this?
3588- LADY CAPULET
3589- Accursed, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!
3590- Most miserable hour that e'er time saw
3591- In lasting labour of his pilgrimage!
3592- But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,
3593- But one thing to rejoice and solace in,
3594- And cruel death hath catch'd it from my sight!
3595- Nurse
3596- O woe! O woful, woful, woful day!
3597- Most lamentable day, most woful day,
3598- That ever, ever, I did yet behold!
3599- O day! O day! O day! O hateful day!
3600- Never was seen so black a day as this:
3601- O woful day, O woful day!
3602- PARIS
3603- Beguiled, divorced, wronged, spited, slain!
3604- Most detestable death, by thee beguil'd,
3605- By cruel cruel thee quite overthrown!
3606- O love! O life! not life, but love in death!
3607- CAPULET
3608- Despised, distressed, hated, martyr'd, kill'd!
3609- Uncomfortable time, why camest thou now
3610- To murder, murder our solemnity?
3611- O child! O child! my soul, and not my child!
3612- Dead art thou! Alack! my child is dead;
3613- And with my child my joys are buried.
3614- FRIAR LAURENCE
3615- Peace, ho, for shame! confusion's cure lives not
3616- In these confusions. Heaven and yourself
3617- Had part in this fair maid; now heaven hath all,
3618- And all the better is it for the maid:
3619- Your part in her you could not keep from death,
3620- But heaven keeps his part in eternal life.
3621- The most you sought was her promotion;
3622- For 'twas your heaven she should be advanced:
3623- And weep ye now, seeing she is advanced
3624- Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?
3625- O, in this love, you love your child so ill,
3626- That you run mad, seeing that she is well:
3627- She's not well married that lives married long;
3628- But she's best married that dies married young.
3629- Dry up your tears, and stick your rosemary
3630- On this fair corse; and, as the custom is,
3631- In all her best array bear her to church:
3632- For though fond nature bids us an lament,
3633- Yet nature's tears are reason's merriment.
3634- CAPULET
3635- All things that we ordained festival,
3636- Turn from their office to black funeral;
3637- Our instruments to melancholy bells,
3638- Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast,
3639- Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change,
3640- Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse,
3641- And all things change them to the contrary.
3642- FRIAR LAURENCE
3643- Sir, go you in; and, madam, go with him;
3644- And go, Sir Paris; every one prepare
3645- To follow this fair corse unto her grave:
3646- The heavens do lour upon you for some ill;
3647- Move them no more by crossing their high will.
3648- Exeunt CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, PARIS, and FRIAR LAURENCE
3649- 
3650- First Musician
3651- Faith, we may put up our pipes, and be gone.
3652- Nurse
3653- Honest goodfellows, ah, put up, put up;
3654- For, well you know, this is a pitiful case.
3655- Exit
3656- 
3657- First Musician
3658- Ay, by my troth, the case may be amended.
3659- Enter PETER
3660- 
3661- PETER
3662- Musicians, O, musicians, 'Heart's ease, Heart's
3663- ease:' O, an you will have me live, play 'Heart's ease.'
3664- First Musician
3665- Why 'Heart's ease?'
3666- PETER
3667- O, musicians, because my heart itself plays 'My
3668- heart is full of woe:' O, play me some merry dump,
3669- to comfort me.
3670- First Musician
3671- Not a dump we; 'tis no time to play now.
3672- PETER
3673- You will not, then?
3674- First Musician
3675- No.
3676- PETER
3677- I will then give it you soundly.
3678- First Musician
3679- What will you give us?
3680- PETER
3681- No money, on my faith, but the gleek;
3682- I will give you the minstrel.
3683- First Musician
3684- Then I will give you the serving-creature.
3685- PETER
3686- Then will I lay the serving-creature's dagger on
3687- your pate. I will carry no crotchets: I'll re you,
3688- I'll fa you; do you note me?
3689- First Musician
3690- An you re us and fa us, you note us.
3691- Second Musician
3692- Pray you, put up your dagger, and put out your wit.
3693- PETER
3694- Then have at you with my wit! I will dry-beat you
3695- with an iron wit, and put up my iron dagger. Answer
3696- me like men:
3697- 'When griping grief the heart doth wound,
3698- And doleful dumps the mind oppress,
3699- Then music with her silver sound'--
3700- why 'silver sound'? why 'music with her silver
3701- sound'? What say you, Simon Catling?
3702- Musician
3703- Marry, sir, because silver hath a sweet sound.
3704- PETER
3705- Pretty! What say you, Hugh Rebeck?
3706- Second Musician
3707- I say 'silver sound,' because musicians sound for silver.
3708- PETER
3709- Pretty too! What say you, James Soundpost?
3710- Third Musician
3711- Faith, I know not what to say.
3712- PETER
3713- O, I cry you mercy; you are the singer: I will say
3714- for you. It is 'music with her silver sound,'
3715- because musicians have no gold for sounding:
3716- 'Then music with her silver sound
3717- With speedy help doth lend redress.'
3718- Exit
3719- 
3720- First Musician
3721- What a pestilent knave is this same!
3722- Second Musician
3723- Hang him, Jack! Come, we'll in here; tarry for the
3724- mourners, and stay dinner.
3725- Exeunt
3726- 
3727- ACT V
3728- 
3729- SCENE I. Mantua. A street.
3730- 
3731- Enter ROMEO
3732- ROMEO
3733- If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep,
3734- My dreams presage some joyful news at hand:
3735- My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne;
3736- And all this day an unaccustom'd spirit
3737- Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.
3738- I dreamt my lady came and found me dead--
3739- Strange dream, that gives a dead man leave
3740- to think!--
3741- And breathed such life with kisses in my lips,
3742- That I revived, and was an emperor.
3743- Ah me! how sweet is love itself possess'd,
3744- When but love's shadows are so rich in joy!
3745- Enter BALTHASAR, booted
3746- 
3747- News from Verona!--How now, Balthasar!
3748- Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar?
3749- How doth my lady? Is my father well?
3750- How fares my Juliet? that I ask again;
3751- For nothing can be ill, if she be well.
3752- BALTHASAR
3753- Then she is well, and nothing can be ill:
3754- Her body sleeps in Capel's monument,
3755- And her immortal part with angels lives.
3756- I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault,
3757- And presently took post to tell it you:
3758- O, pardon me for bringing these ill news,
3759- Since you did leave it for my office, sir.
3760- ROMEO
3761- Is it even so? then I defy you, stars!
3762- Thou know'st my lodging: get me ink and paper,
3763- And hire post-horses; I will hence to-night.
3764- BALTHASAR
3765- I do beseech you, sir, have patience:
3766- Your looks are pale and wild, and do import
3767- Some misadventure.
3768- ROMEO
3769- Tush, thou art deceived:
3770- Leave me, and do the thing I bid thee do.
3771- Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?
3772- BALTHASAR
3773- No, my good lord.
3774- ROMEO
3775- No matter: get thee gone,
3776- And hire those horses; I'll be with thee straight.
3777- Exit BALTHASAR
3778- 
3779- Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee to-night.
3780- Let's see for means: O mischief, thou art swift
3781- To enter in the thoughts of desperate men!
3782- I do remember an apothecary,--
3783- And hereabouts he dwells,--which late I noted
3784- In tatter'd weeds, with overwhelming brows,
3785- Culling of simples; meagre were his looks,
3786- Sharp misery had worn him to the bones:
3787- And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,
3788- An alligator stuff'd, and other skins
3789- Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves
3790- A beggarly account of empty boxes,
3791- Green earthen pots, bladders and musty seeds,
3792- Remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses,
3793- Were thinly scatter'd, to make up a show.
3794- Noting this penury, to myself I said
3795- 'An if a man did need a poison now,
3796- Whose sale is present death in Mantua,
3797- Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.'
3798- O, this same thought did but forerun my need;
3799- And this same needy man must sell it me.
3800- As I remember, this should be the house.
3801- Being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut.
3802- What, ho! apothecary!
3803- Enter Apothecary
3804- 
3805- Apothecary
3806- Who calls so loud?
3807- ROMEO
3808- Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor:
3809- Hold, there is forty ducats: let me have
3810- A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear
3811- As will disperse itself through all the veins
3812- That the life-weary taker may fall dead
3813- And that the trunk may be discharged of breath
3814- As violently as hasty powder fired
3815- Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.
3816- Apothecary
3817- Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua's law
3818- Is death to any he that utters them.
3819- ROMEO
3820- Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness,
3821- And fear'st to die? famine is in thy cheeks,
3822- Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,
3823- Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back;
3824- The world is not thy friend nor the world's law;
3825- The world affords no law to make thee rich;
3826- Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.
3827- Apothecary
3828- My poverty, but not my will, consents.
3829- ROMEO
3830- I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.
3831- Apothecary
3832- Put this in any liquid thing you will,
3833- And drink it off; and, if you had the strength
3834- Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.
3835- ROMEO
3836- There is thy gold, worse poison to men's souls,
3837- Doing more murders in this loathsome world,
3838- Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.
3839- I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.
3840- Farewell: buy food, and get thyself in flesh.
3841- Come, cordial and not poison, go with me
3842- To Juliet's grave; for there must I use thee.
3843- Exeunt
3844- 
3845- SCENE II. Friar Laurence's cell.
3846- 
3847- Enter FRIAR JOHN
3848- FRIAR JOHN
3849- Holy Franciscan friar! brother, ho!
3850- Enter FRIAR LAURENCE
3851- 
3852- FRIAR LAURENCE
3853- This same should be the voice of Friar John.
3854- Welcome from Mantua: what says Romeo?
3855- Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.
3856- FRIAR JOHN
3857- Going to find a bare-foot brother out
3858- One of our order, to associate me,
3859- Here in this city visiting the sick,
3860- And finding him, the searchers of the town,
3861- Suspecting that we both were in a house
3862- Where the infectious pestilence did reign,
3863- Seal'd up the doors, and would not let us forth;
3864- So that my speed to Mantua there was stay'd.
3865- FRIAR LAURENCE
3866- Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo?
3867- FRIAR JOHN
3868- I could not send it,--here it is again,--
3869- Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,
3870- So fearful were they of infection.
3871- FRIAR LAURENCE
3872- Unhappy fortune! by my brotherhood,
3873- The letter was not nice but full of charge
3874- Of dear import, and the neglecting it
3875- May do much danger. Friar John, go hence;
3876- Get me an iron crow, and bring it straight
3877- Unto my cell.
3878- FRIAR JOHN
3879- Brother, I'll go and bring it thee.
3880- Exit
3881- 
3882- FRIAR LAURENCE
3883- Now must I to the monument alone;
3884- Within three hours will fair Juliet wake:
3885- She will beshrew me much that Romeo
3886- Hath had no notice of these accidents;
3887- But I will write again to Mantua,
3888- And keep her at my cell till Romeo come;
3889- Poor living corse, closed in a dead man's tomb!
3890- Exit
3891- 
3892- SCENE III. A churchyard; in it a tomb belonging to the Capulets.
3893- 
3894- Enter PARIS, and his Page bearing flowers and a torch
3895- PARIS
3896- Give me thy torch, boy: hence, and stand aloof:
3897- Yet put it out, for I would not be seen.
3898- Under yond yew-trees lay thee all along,
3899- Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground;
3900- So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread,
3901- Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves,
3902- But thou shalt hear it: whistle then to me,
3903- As signal that thou hear'st something approach.
3904- Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee, go.
3905- PAGE
3906- [Aside] I am almost afraid to stand alone
3907- Here in the churchyard; yet I will adventure.
3908- Retires
3909- 
3910- PARIS
3911- Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew,--
3912- O woe! thy canopy is dust and stones;--
3913- Which with sweet water nightly I will dew,
3914- Or, wanting that, with tears distill'd by moans:
3915- The obsequies that I for thee will keep
3916- Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep.
3917- The Page whistles
3918- 
3919- The boy gives warning something doth approach.
3920- What cursed foot wanders this way to-night,
3921- To cross my obsequies and true love's rite?
3922- What with a torch! muffle me, night, awhile.
3923- Retires
3924- 
3925- Enter ROMEO and BALTHASAR, with a torch, mattock, & c
3926- 
3927- ROMEO
3928- Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.
3929- Hold, take this letter; early in the morning
3930- See thou deliver it to my lord and father.
3931- Give me the light: upon thy life, I charge thee,
3932- Whate'er thou hear'st or seest, stand all aloof,
3933- And do not interrupt me in my course.
3934- Why I descend into this bed of death,
3935- Is partly to behold my lady's face;
3936- But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger
3937- A precious ring, a ring that I must use
3938- In dear employment: therefore hence, be gone:
3939- But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry
3940- In what I further shall intend to do,
3941- By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint
3942- And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs:
3943- The time and my intents are savage-wild,
3944- More fierce and more inexorable far
3945- Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.
3946- BALTHASAR
3947- I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.
3948- ROMEO
3949- So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that:
3950- Live, and be prosperous: and farewell, good fellow.
3951- BALTHASAR
3952- [Aside] For all this same, I'll hide me hereabout:
3953- His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt.
3954- Retires
3955- 
3956- ROMEO
3957- Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,
3958- Gorged with the dearest morsel of the earth,
3959- Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,
3960- And, in despite, I'll cram thee with more food!
3961- Opens the tomb
3962- 
3963- PARIS
3964- This is that banish'd haughty Montague,
3965- That murder'd my love's cousin, with which grief,
3966- It is supposed, the fair creature died;
3967- And here is come to do some villanous shame
3968- To the dead bodies: I will apprehend him.
3969- Comes forward
3970- 
3971- Stop thy unhallow'd toil, vile Montague!
3972- Can vengeance be pursued further than death?
3973- Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee:
3974- Obey, and go with me; for thou must die.
3975- ROMEO
3976- I must indeed; and therefore came I hither.
3977- Good gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man;
3978- Fly hence, and leave me: think upon these gone;
3979- Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,
3980- Put not another sin upon my head,
3981- By urging me to fury: O, be gone!
3982- By heaven, I love thee better than myself;
3983- For I come hither arm'd against myself:
3984- Stay not, be gone; live, and hereafter say,
3985- A madman's mercy bade thee run away.
3986- PARIS
3987- I do defy thy conjurations,
3988- And apprehend thee for a felon here.
3989- ROMEO
3990- Wilt thou provoke me? then have at thee, boy!
3991- They fight
3992- 
3993- PAGE
3994- O Lord, they fight! I will go call the watch.
3995- Exit
3996- 
3997- PARIS
3998- O, I am slain!
3999- Falls
4000- 
4001- If thou be merciful,
4002- Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet.
4003- Dies
4004- 
4005- ROMEO
4006- In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.
4007- Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris!
4008- What said my man, when my betossed soul
4009- Did not attend him as we rode? I think
4010- He told me Paris should have married Juliet:
4011- Said he not so? or did I dream it so?
4012- Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet,
4013- To think it was so? O, give me thy hand,
4014- One writ with me in sour misfortune's book!
4015- I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave;
4016- A grave? O no! a lantern, slaughter'd youth,
4017- For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes
4018- This vault a feasting presence full of light.
4019- Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd.
4020- Laying PARIS in the tomb
4021- 
4022- How oft when men are at the point of death
4023- Have they been merry! which their keepers call
4024- A lightning before death: O, how may I
4025- Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife!
4026- Death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath,
4027- Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty:
4028- Thou art not conquer'd; beauty's ensign yet
4029- Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,
4030- And death's pale flag is not advanced there.
4031- Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?
4032- O, what more favour can I do to thee,
4033- Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
4034- To sunder his that was thine enemy?
4035- Forgive me, cousin! Ah, dear Juliet,
4036- Why art thou yet so fair? shall I believe
4037- That unsubstantial death is amorous,
4038- And that the lean abhorred monster keeps
4039- Thee here in dark to be his paramour?
4040- For fear of that, I still will stay with thee;
4041- And never from this palace of dim night
4042- Depart again: here, here will I remain
4043- With worms that are thy chamber-maids; O, here
4044- Will I set up my everlasting rest,
4045- And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
4046- From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!
4047- Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you
4048- The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss
4049- A dateless bargain to engrossing death!
4050- Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide!
4051- Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on
4052- The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark!
4053- Here's to my love!
4054- Drinks
4055- 
4056- O true apothecary!
4057- Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.
4058- Dies
4059- 
4060- Enter, at the other end of the churchyard, FRIAR LAURENCE, with a lantern, crow, and spade
4061- 
4062- FRIAR LAURENCE
4063- Saint Francis be my speed! how oft to-night
4064- Have my old feet stumbled at graves! Who's there?
4065- BALTHASAR
4066- Here's one, a friend, and one that knows you well.
4067- FRIAR LAURENCE
4068- Bliss be upon you! Tell me, good my friend,
4069- What torch is yond, that vainly lends his light
4070- To grubs and eyeless skulls? as I discern,
4071- It burneth in the Capel's monument.
4072- BALTHASAR
4073- It doth so, holy sir; and there's my master,
4074- One that you love.
4075- FRIAR LAURENCE
4076- Who is it?
4077- BALTHASAR
4078- Romeo.
4079- FRIAR LAURENCE
4080- How long hath he been there?
4081- BALTHASAR
4082- Full half an hour.
4083- FRIAR LAURENCE
4084- Go with me to the vault.
4085- BALTHASAR
4086- I dare not, sir
4087- My master knows not but I am gone hence;
4088- And fearfully did menace me with death,
4089- If I did stay to look on his intents.
4090- FRIAR LAURENCE
4091- Stay, then; I'll go alone. Fear comes upon me:
4092- O, much I fear some ill unlucky thing.
4093- BALTHASAR
4094- As I did sleep under this yew-tree here,
4095- I dreamt my master and another fought,
4096- And that my master slew him.
4097- FRIAR LAURENCE
4098- Romeo!
4099- Advances
4100- 
4101- Alack, alack, what blood is this, which stains
4102- The stony entrance of this sepulchre?
4103- What mean these masterless and gory swords
4104- To lie discolour'd by this place of peace?
4105- Enters the tomb
4106- 
4107- Romeo! O, pale! Who else? what, Paris too?
4108- And steep'd in blood? Ah, what an unkind hour
4109- Is guilty of this lamentable chance!
4110- The lady stirs.
4111- JULIET wakes
4112- 
4113- JULIET
4114- O comfortable friar! where is my lord?
4115- I do remember well where I should be,
4116- And there I am. Where is my Romeo?
4117- Noise within
4118- 
4119- FRIAR LAURENCE
4120- I hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest
4121- Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep:
4122- A greater power than we can contradict
4123- Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away.
4124- Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;
4125- And Paris too. Come, I'll dispose of thee
4126- Among a sisterhood of holy nuns:
4127- Stay not to question, for the watch is coming;
4128- Come, go, good Juliet,
4129- Noise again
4130- 
4131- I dare no longer stay.
4132- JULIET
4133- Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.
4134- Exit FRIAR LAURENCE
4135- 
4136- What's here? a cup, closed in my true love's hand?
4137- Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end:
4138- O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop
4139- To help me after? I will kiss thy lips;
4140- Haply some poison yet doth hang on them,
4141- To make die with a restorative.
4142- Kisses him
4143- 
4144- Thy lips are warm.
4145- First Watchman
4146- [Within] Lead, boy: which way?
4147- JULIET
4148- Yea, noise? then I'll be brief. O happy dagger!
4149- Snatching ROMEO's dagger
4150- 
4151- This is thy sheath;
4152- Stabs herself
4153- 
4154- there rust, and let me die.
4155- Falls on ROMEO's body, and dies
4156- 
4157- Enter Watch, with the Page of PARIS
4158- 
4159- PAGE
4160- This is the place; there, where the torch doth burn.
4161- First Watchman
4162- The ground is bloody; search about the churchyard:
4163- Go, some of you, whoe'er you find attach.
4164- Pitiful sight! here lies the county slain,
4165- And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,
4166- Who here hath lain these two days buried.
4167- Go, tell the prince: run to the Capulets:
4168- Raise up the Montagues: some others search:
4169- We see the ground whereon these woes do lie;
4170- But the true ground of all these piteous woes
4171- We cannot without circumstance descry.
4172- Re-enter some of the Watch, with BALTHASAR
4173- 
4174- Second Watchman
4175- Here's Romeo's man; we found him in the churchyard.
4176- First Watchman
4177- Hold him in safety, till the prince come hither.
4178- Re-enter others of the Watch, with FRIAR LAURENCE
4179- 
4180- Third Watchman
4181- Here is a friar, that trembles, sighs and weeps:
4182- We took this mattock and this spade from him,
4183- As he was coming from this churchyard side.
4184- First Watchman
4185- A great suspicion: stay the friar too.
4186- Enter the PRINCE and Attendants
4187- 
4188- PRINCE
4189- What misadventure is so early up,
4190- That calls our person from our morning's rest?
4191- Enter CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, and others
4192- 
4193- CAPULET
4194- What should it be, that they so shriek abroad?
4195- LADY CAPULET
4196- The people in the street cry Romeo,
4197- Some Juliet, and some Paris; and all run,
4198- With open outcry toward our monument.
4199- PRINCE
4200- What fear is this which startles in our ears?
4201- First Watchman
4202- Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain;
4203- And Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before,
4204- Warm and new kill'd.
4205- PRINCE
4206- Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.
4207- First Watchman
4208- Here is a friar, and slaughter'd Romeo's man;
4209- With instruments upon them, fit to open
4210- These dead men's tombs.
4211- CAPULET
4212- O heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!
4213- This dagger hath mista'en--for, lo, his house
4214- Is empty on the back of Montague,--
4215- And it mis-sheathed in my daughter's bosom!
4216- LADY CAPULET
4217- O me! this sight of death is as a bell,
4218- That warns my old age to a sepulchre.
4219- Enter MONTAGUE and others
4220- 
4221- PRINCE
4222- Come, Montague; for thou art early up,
4223- To see thy son and heir more early down.
4224- MONTAGUE
4225- Alas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night;
4226- Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath:
4227- What further woe conspires against mine age?
4228- PRINCE
4229- Look, and thou shalt see.
4230- MONTAGUE
4231- O thou untaught! what manners is in this?
4232- To press before thy father to a grave?
4233- PRINCE
4234- Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,
4235- Till we can clear these ambiguities,
4236- And know their spring, their head, their
4237- true descent;
4238- And then will I be general of your woes,
4239- And lead you even to death: meantime forbear,
4240- And let mischance be slave to patience.
4241- Bring forth the parties of suspicion.
4242- FRIAR LAURENCE
4243- I am the greatest, able to do least,
4244- Yet most suspected, as the time and place
4245- Doth make against me of this direful murder;
4246- And here I stand, both to impeach and purge
4247- Myself condemned and myself excused.
4248- PRINCE
4249- Then say at once what thou dost know in this.
4250- FRIAR LAURENCE
4251- I will be brief, for my short date of breath
4252- Is not so long as is a tedious tale.
4253- Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;
4254- And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife:
4255- I married them; and their stol'n marriage-day
4256- Was Tybalt's dooms-day, whose untimely death
4257- Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from the city,
4258- For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined.
4259- You, to remove that siege of grief from her,
4260- Betroth'd and would have married her perforce
4261- To County Paris: then comes she to me,
4262- And, with wild looks, bid me devise some mean
4263- To rid her from this second marriage,
4264- Or in my cell there would she kill herself.
4265- Then gave I her, so tutor'd by my art,
4266- A sleeping potion; which so took effect
4267- As I intended, for it wrought on her
4268- The form of death: meantime I writ to Romeo,
4269- That he should hither come as this dire night,
4270- To help to take her from her borrow'd grave,
4271- Being the time the potion's force should cease.
4272- But he which bore my letter, Friar John,
4273- Was stay'd by accident, and yesternight
4274- Return'd my letter back. Then all alone
4275- At the prefixed hour of her waking,
4276- Came I to take her from her kindred's vault;
4277- Meaning to keep her closely at my cell,
4278- Till I conveniently could send to Romeo:
4279- But when I came, some minute ere the time
4280- Of her awaking, here untimely lay
4281- The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.
4282- She wakes; and I entreated her come forth,
4283- And bear this work of heaven with patience:
4284- But then a noise did scare me from the tomb;
4285- And she, too desperate, would not go with me,
4286- But, as it seems, did violence on herself.
4287- All this I know; and to the marriage
4288- Her nurse is privy: and, if aught in this
4289- Miscarried by my fault, let my old life
4290- Be sacrificed, some hour before his time,
4291- Unto the rigour of severest law.
4292- PRINCE
4293- We still have known thee for a holy man.
4294- Where's Romeo's man? what can he say in this?
4295- BALTHASAR
4296- I brought my master news of Juliet's death;
4297- And then in post he came from Mantua
4298- To this same place, to this same monument.
4299- This letter he early bid me give his father,
4300- And threatened me with death, going in the vault,
4301- I departed not and left him there.
4302- PRINCE
4303- Give me the letter; I will look on it.
4304- Where is the county's page, that raised the watch?
4305- Sirrah, what made your master in this place?
4306- PAGE
4307- He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave;
4308- And bid me stand aloof, and so I did:
4309- Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;
4310- And by and by my master drew on him;
4311- And then I ran away to call the watch.
4312- PRINCE
4313- This letter doth make good the friar's words,
4314- Their course of love, the tidings of her death:
4315- And here he writes that he did buy a poison
4316- Of a poor 'pothecary, and therewithal
4317- Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.
4318- Where be these enemies? Capulet! Montague!
4319- See, what a scourge is laid upon your hate,
4320- That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love.
4321- And I for winking at your discords too
4322- Have lost a brace of kinsmen: all are punish'd.
4323- CAPULET
4324- O brother Montague, give me thy hand:
4325- This is my daughter's jointure, for no more
4326- Can I demand.
4327- MONTAGUE
4328- But I can give thee more:
4329- For I will raise her statue in pure gold;
4330- That while Verona by that name is known,
4331- There shall no figure at such rate be set
4332- As that of true and faithful Juliet.
4333- CAPULET
4334- As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie;
4335- Poor sacrifices of our enmity!
4336- PRINCE
4337- A glooming peace this morning with it brings;
4338- The sun, for sorrow, will not show his head:
4339- Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;
4340- Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished:
4341- For never was a story of more woe
4342- Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.
4343- Exeunt
